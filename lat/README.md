# Lateral Thinking tool

Was in sqlite for a while, but decided to keep my PostgreSQL functions, soâ€¦

# TODO:

* PostgreSQL connection for Lua
* JSON decoding for Lua
* helper function to pass query to PostgreSQL, decode JSON, return
* change menu to reference PostgreSQL API function instead of Lat. Lua function
