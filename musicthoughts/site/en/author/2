	<q>I talk to many young painters, because I teach art in schools. I ask them: <br> <br>Why do you think that what you do ends at the edges of this canvas?  <br> <br>Think of the frame. What frame are you working in? Not just that bit of wood around the edge, but the room you&#39;re in, the light you&#39;re in, the time and place you&#39;re in. How can you redesign it? <br> <br>I would say that to musicians, too. I see them spending a lot of time working on the internal details of what they&#39;re doing and far less time working on the ways of positioning it in the world. <br> <br>By &quot;positioning it&quot; I don&#39;t only mean thinking of ways to get it to a record company, but thinking of where it could go, and where it fits in the cultural picture.  What else does it relate to?</q>

	<q>A non-musician is thrilled to be doing music - quite happy to sit there and plunk one note all day- and is very alert to the effect of that.<br><br>Nonmusicians really LISTEN sometimes, because that&#39;s the only thing they have available to them.</q>

	<q>If you have a bunch of people sitting in one room and working on one piece of music, and getting immersed in that piece of music, everyone&#39;s thinking they should say something just to prove that they&#39;re still paying attention, because it&#39;s embarrassing to sit in a corner for four hours. <br> <br>It&#39;s much more important for people to genuinely feel they have something to contribute than just interject for the sake of it.</q>

	<q>Cut a vital connection. <br> <br>That&#39;s a very interesting thing to do because most pieces of music are based around some centre, like a drum track or a drone, which really holds everything together. Just try taking that element out of the music and see what happens.</q>

	<q>Don&#39;t be ashamed of your own ideas.

Then they play an old James Brown riff and everyone&#39;s saying: &#39;Wow! That&#39;s what we want!&#39; <br> <br>Most of the time musicians are being encouraged to sound recognizable. What I&#39;m doing [as a producer] is encouraging them at the points when they&#39;re not.</q>

	<q>I started coming to the studio with less worked-out pieces, and eventually with nothing at all. I would just start working with that thing, &quot;the studio&quot;, as the instrument. <br> <br>There is nothing outside of this process - this process called recording is the creative process. We don&#39;t have the canvas standing in front of any landscape, you are going to make the landscape here and now.</q>

	<q>Artists who don&#39;t censor their own work: Picasso, Miles Davis, Prince.  They&#39;re all people who just put it out, and have almost no critical self-censorship. They say, &quot;Let the market decide; let the world decide.&quot; You might not be the best person to judge it. <br> <br>That&#39;s a kind of humility, actually: it&#39;s a mixture of arrogance, which says, &quot;I know I&#39;m fucking good.&quot; But a humility, which says, &quot;I&#39;m not the person to decide.&quot;</q>

	<q>The great benefit of computer sequencers is that they remove the issue of skill, and replace it with the issue of judgement.  <br> <br>With Cubase or Photoshop, anybody can actually do anything, and you can make stuff that sounds very much like stuff you&#39;d hear on the radio, or looks very much like anything you see in magazines. <br> <br>So the question becomes not whether you can do it or not, because any drudge can do it if they&#39;re prepared to sit in front of the computer for a few days, the question then is, &quot;Of all the things you can now do, which do you choose to do? &quot;</q>

You have to move around, but you don&#39;t have to dance.  <br> <br>Culture is a biological drive for humans.

	<q>People are hearing a lot more context than music, so perhaps I accept that I am now primarily a context maker. <br> <br>My art is not just what comes out of the end of my trumpet or appears on a record, but a larger experience which is intimately connected to who I appear to be, to my life and charisma. <br> <br>The &#39;music&#39;, the sonic bit, could end up being quite a small part of the whole experience.  <br> <br>Developing the context- the package, the delivery system, the buzz, the spin, the story - might itself become the art.

	<q>When you listen to Miles Davis, how much of what you hear is music,  and how much is context? <br> <br>Context is everything that isn&#39;t physically contained in the grooves of the record.  It includes your knowledge that everyone else says he&#39;s great: that must modify the way you hear him.  That he was a handsome and imposing man, a member of a romantic minority, that he played with Charlie Parker, that he spans generations, that he underwent various addictions, that he married Cicely Tyson, that he dressed well, that Jean-Luc Godard liked him, that he wore shades and was very cool, that he himself said little about his work, and so on.  <br> <br>Surely all that affects how you hear him: I mean, could it possibly have felt the same if he&#39;d been an overweight heating engineer from Oslo? <br> <br>When you listen to music, aren&#39;t you also &#39;listening&#39; to all the stuff around it, too?</q>
