	<q>As much as sound is important to me as an engineer, it is the performance and the feel that sell the record. <br> <br>I know a lot of bad-sounding records that were huge hits because they moved people emotionally, and some records that sounded perfect but didn&#39;t sell shit. <br> <br>I still feel that people have trouble relating to things that are perfect.</q>

	<q>One of the advantages of those days was that we guys went from one date to the next, dealing with all different kinds of music. <br> <br>I mean, I can remember a specific day when I did Ike and Tina Turner from nine to twelve in the morning, Henry Mancini in the afternoon, and then Sam Cooke at night.</q>

	<q>Today if you just do the tracks on two songs in three hours it&#39;s unbelievable, whereas back in the fifties and sixties we would complete four songs in three hours. <br> <br>We even completed an entire Ray Charles album with twelve songs in just seven hours!</q>

	<q>On one occasion Tommy was putting all of this stuff together on the mono master tape and I said, &quot;What would you do if I did this?&quot;  I was kidding around, but by accident my hand actually hit the Record button.  <br> <br>He looked at me and I looked at him and we both jumped to stop the machine, but I had already erased what was on there. <br> <br>We spent hours piecing four or five little outtakes together. No one ever knew what had happened, but that taught me a lesson to never screw around the recording studio.</q>

	<q>When I was six or seven years old my father used to take me to my uncle&#39;s studio... and I&#39;d watch these big bands being recorded with just one microphone. <br> <br>It was the musicians who would be moved around. Soloists got up, came down and played their solos in front of the mike, and then went back and sat down. <br> <br>I can also remember looking out there and seeing all of the guys with no shoes on so that they wouldn&#39;t make a noise when they were stomping.</q>

	<q>Once of the nice things about being successful in this business is that you get to work with successful people. <br> <br>They have the finances to hire the best musicians and work in the best studios with the best equipment. After that you&#39;ve got to be stupid not to get the best sound.</q>
