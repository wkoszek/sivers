	<q>After he&#39;d done a show in Nashville, James Brown asked me to engineer a session for him there. Well, there were no flights available, so I jumped in the car and drove all the way.<br> <br>It took me five hours to get there, and as soon as I arrived at the studio James and the musicians were ready to record, so we cut four tracks and then, before I left, James told his manager, &quot;Give Ron ten percent of that last song.&quot; <br> <br>The song was &quot;Sex Machine&quot; so we wrote up the songwriter&#39;s contract and I&#39;ve been collecting on it ever since!</q>

	<q>James Brown was well known for turning up at recording sessions without having written any songs. He&#39;d just have the idea in his head and when he came in he&#39;d improvise right then and there. <br> <br>He could also play the drums and the keyboard instruments, so he understood exactly what he wanted. He&#39;d build a pattern with the musicians around the bass and drums, and then bring the guitar in. <br> <br>All the musicians worked with James for a long time, so they knew what he wanted, and once he got the rhythm section going he would start working with the horns.</q>

	<q>Whenever James Brown was doing a concert in or near Cincinatti he would come by King Studios late at night and record maybe three or four tracks in just as many hours. <br> <br>At King we had the facility to record, mix, master, press, and label the discs, so the finished product could be ready for shipping within 24 hours.</q>
