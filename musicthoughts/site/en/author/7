	<q>Failure, for some people, is a vital survival skill. <br> <br>To work at an artistic level that has some chance of changing the world means risking that your work will change you. <br> <br>We all know people who have lots of drive, talent, and stability, people whose ideas fall perfectly in place at the leading edge of the mass audience input curve, but who just aren&#39;t successful. They work hard and they mean well, but things never quite jell for them, you know?  <br> <br>My bet is they&#39;ve already signed an unknown contract to fail. <br> <br>Have you?</q>

	<q>As for fame being power, and all power corrupting, that really isn&#39;t the case. <br> <br>Power per se is neither positive nor negative. Lots of famous people are perfectly nice folks... but they either started out that way or else screwed up so badly along the path they were forced to get their act together. <br> <br>A jerk with money, after all, is still a jerk.</q>

	<q>Fame increases some of your options in this world. But it limits others. <br> <br>Celebrity may look interesting, but being in the limelight means you can&#39;t really see anything around you. <br> <br>Was the joke you just told really that funny? Does your date like you or your bank balance? When was the last time you bought groceries without being stared at?</q>

	<li><blockquote cite="/t/134">
	<q>The problem facing you as an artist is the degree to which you are willing to alter your art, if required, to stay within the current bounds of the loop. <br> <br>First time out, no problem. You create something. People like it or they don&#39;t, and it really doesn&#39;t matter which way the dice tumble, so long as you are now out of the closet as an artist. <br> <br>The real problem enters when you have finally put together a piece of art that a lot of people like; that day when you achieve &quot;success.&quot; Like it or not, you have also become a brand. An identity.   Score twice in the same category and you&#39;ve virtually tattooed it across your forehead. <br> <br>The marketing superstructure that automatically surrounds commercial success will bring pressure against trying anything new.</q>
