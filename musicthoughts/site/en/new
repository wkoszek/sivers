	<q>Two different ways of making things: the hard way and the easy way.  <br> <br>The hard way is the way of the individual artist who establishes his own terrain, as it were. The easy way is the way of grace and the way of tradition, where you don&#39;t even consider the possibility that you are there to make major innovations - you&#39;re there to make 200 parts today.   <br> <br>One of the things I like about gospel music is that it has that same kind of humility, that the people who are singing it are not puckered-brow artists. There&#39;s the same freshness and thrill that you see in all kinds of folk arts. People doing something that is shaped by a whole lot of quite unconscious factors, like the limitations of their own vocal range.</q>

Lots of people are doing things that are not dramatic or radical or not even particularly interesting; they&#39;re just digestive processes. A number of little things are being combined and tried out. <br> <br>If you think about music in that way, it makes it much easier to accept that there might be lots of things you might not want to hear again.
