	<q>When you listen to Miles Davis, how much of what you hear is music,  and how much is context? <br> <br>Context is everything that isn&#39;t physically contained in the grooves of the record.  It includes your knowledge that everyone else says he&#39;s great: that must modify the way you hear him.  That he was a handsome and imposing man, a member of a romantic minority, that he played with Charlie Parker, that he spans generations, that he underwent various addictions, that he married Cicely Tyson, that he dressed well, that Jean-Luc Godard liked him, that he wore shades and was very cool, that he himself said little about his work, and so on.  <br> <br>Surely all that affects how you hear him: I mean, could it possibly have felt the same if he&#39;d been an overweight heating engineer from Oslo? <br> <br>When you listen to music, aren&#39;t you also &#39;listening&#39; to all the stuff around it, too?</q>
