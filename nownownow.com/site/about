<h1>about <a href="/">nownownow.com</a></h1>

<p>
If anything here is unclear, please <a href="#who">let me know</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="what">What is a “now page”?</h2>
<p>
Most websites have a link that says “<strong>about</strong>”.
It goes to a page that tells you something about the background of this person or business.
For short, people just call it an “about page”.
</p><p>
Most websites have a link that says “<strong>contact</strong>”.
It goes to a page that tells you how to contact this person or business.
For short, people just call it a “contact page”.
</p><p>
So a website with a link that says “<strong>now</strong>”
goes to a page that tells you <strong>what this person is focused on at this point in their life.</strong>
For short, we call it a “now page”.
</p><p>
See examples by browsing <a href="/">nownownow.com</a>.
</p><p>
Although it’s normal to make the web address “/now”, just like it’s usually “/about” and “/contact” in those other examples, the URL could be anything.
</p>


<h2 id="social">Don’t Twitter and Facebook updates do that?</h2>
<p>
No.
If I wonder how someone is doing these days, it doesn’t help me to see that they went on vacation last week, are upset about something in the news, or even got a new job.
That’s not the big picture.
</p><p>
Think of <strong>what you’d tell a friend you hadn’t seen in a year</strong>.
</p><p>
Like, “Still living in Dallas, though considering moving to Austin. Working at ABC. Really getting into cycling. The kids are age 3 and 6. I’m reading a lot of Pema Chödrön, and listening to  a lot of jazz piano especially Brad Mehldau. I’ve stopped taking on web design clients, since I’d rather keep improving my back-end database work.”
</p><p>
That’s what a now page is for.
You can’t get that big picture from any other outlets I’m aware of.
</p>


<h2 id="why">Why do I need a now page?</h2>
<p>
If you’re not already feeling that this would be very useful to you, then you don’t need one.
</p><p>
If you don’t already have your own website, with an “about” page that’s about you personally, then this isn’t for you.
</p><p>
This isn’t for marketing or attention.
It will not benefit you in any business way.
</p><p>
It’s useful <strong>for the same reason an “about” page is useful on your site</strong>: because people on your site want to know more about you.
</p><p>
Besides answering the common question, “What are you up to these days?”, those who have a now page say it’s a good reminder of their priorities.
By publicly showing what you are focused on now, it helps you say no to other requests.
</p><p>
<em>“A few days ago I added my now page and felt an immediate since of relief from pitch emails that ignored the fact that I said explicitly on my site that my team and I can’t handle unsolicited pitches. Simple idea. Big impact.”</em> — <a href="http://nerdzach.com/now/">Zach Ware</a>
</p><p>
<em>“Any time I’m in something that kind of feels useful or fun, but isn’t clearly aligned with my bigger goals, I pull up my now page and ask ‘Is it on there? Should I add it?’ Most of the time the answer is no, and I move on. Sometimes its yes, and when it is, at least it’s an intentional priority shift.”</em> — <a href="http://practicingdeveloper.com/now/">Gregory Brown</a>
</p>


<h2 id="whatnow">So what is nownownow.com?</h2>
<p>
After a few people added a /now page to their site — (<a href="http://sivers.org/nowff">see original story</a>) — <a href="http://gregalbritton.com/now">Greg Albritton</a> suggested we keep <strong>a collection of everyone that has a /now page</strong>.
</p><p>
That’s all this is.
It’s not a business.
It’s not social media.
</p><p>
<a href="http://sivers.org/now3">See the announcement and story here</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="hownow">How do I get listed on nownownow.com?</h2>
<p>
<strong>If you already have your own website with a /now page on it</strong>, as described and defined above, just email the URL to me at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a>.
After you do, I’ll email you back with a link to log in and answer a few questions, which, when done, will create a profile page for you.
</p><p>
If not, <a href="#how">see below</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="how">How do I make a now page?</h2>
<p>
<strong>If you already have a website, but don’t have a /now page</strong>, just add a new page.
If you’re using WordPress, look for “Pages” on the left, and choose “Add New”.
Give it a “permalink” of /now.
(Sorry I can’t help with tech support.)
</p><p>
Write something about what you’re doing now, and publish.
Once it’s online, email me the URL.
</p><p>
<strong>If you don’t have a website</strong>, but have been meaning to get one, create a free one at <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>.
Before you announce it, I highly recommend getting your own domain name at <a href="https://www.hover.com/">hover.com</a>.
Point your domain to your WordPress blog, and use that.
(Again, sorry I can’t help with tech support, but this is very common stuff, so anyone else can.)
</p><p>
A new service called <strong><a href="https://ournows.com/">Our/Nows</a></strong> has set up just to help you make a /now page, without your own website.
</p>


<h2 id="biz">Can we add our business here?</h2>
<p>
No.
Browsing <a href="/">nownownow.com</a> is only interesting because you get a glimpse into people’s lives and how they focus.
</p><p>
If it became full of businesses, it would lose its appeal, and I’d probably just shut down this site.
</p><p>
If you have a business website that is really just you, <a href="http://www.shakespeareconsultant.com/now/">like this example</a>, then that’s OK.
But other than that, I won’t be adding business sites.
</p>


<h2 id="add">You know what this needs? …</h2>
<p>
Please tell me.
I’m here as a public servant, taking requests.
</p><p>
Or just make something first, and let me know.
No need to ask my permission.
</p><p>
Some people have done some cool things with this already, like <a href="https://github.com/haroldtreen/query-nownownow">this query tool</a>, <a href="http://cm-506211.silk.co/">this map</a> and <a href="http://nownownow.herokuapp.com/">this word cloud</a>.
</p>


<h2 id="who">Who is behind this?</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a>.
That’s me.
</p><p>
I’m just doing this because people have asked me to.
Email me at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a> with any questions or suggestions.
