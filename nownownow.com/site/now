How clever you are, looking to see if <a href="http://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a> has a /now page.
</p><p>
That is so meta, it’s crazy.
</p><p>
OK then. Here’s your reward.
</p>

<h2>What I’m doing now</h2>

<ul>
	<li id="now1"></li>
	<li id="now2"></li>
	<li id="now3"></li>
	<li id="now4"></li>
	<li id="now5"></li>
	<li id="now6"></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are my priorities right now. I’m not open to anything else. When my priorities change, I will update this page. Last update was <span id="now"></span>.</p>
