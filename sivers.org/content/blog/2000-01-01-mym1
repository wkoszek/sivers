	Hi.
	I’m <a href="/">Derek Sivers</a>.
</p><p>
	This book is about you and your music.
	But before we talk about you, I have to tell you one thing about me, for it to make sense.
</p><p>
	All I wanted from age 14 was to be a successful musician.
</p><p>
	First I graduated from Berklee College of Music in Boston.
	Then I got a job at Warner/Chappell Music Publishing in New York City.
	During my two years there, I learned a ton about how the major-label music industry works.
	Then at age 22, I quit my job, and became a full-time professional musician.
</p><p>
	All-in-all, I was a full-time musician for twelve years in New York City and Boston.
	I've done over a thousand shows of all types.
	Produced, played, sessions, studios, stadiums, side-man, front-man, tours, TV, colleges, etc.
	I also ran a recording studio, booking agency, record label, and more.
</p><p>
	Anything you can do to make (or lose) money as a musician, I’ve done it.
</p><p>
	It was hard as hell, but went pretty well.
	I made enough money doing music that I bought a house in Woodstock.
	I was living the dream.
</p><p>
	Then I started CD Baby.
	It was meant to be a hobby to help a few friends, but it soon became the largest seller of independent music online.
	Over 150,000 musicians sold their music directly through me.
	(I have another book about that, called “<a href="/a">Anything You Want</a>”, if you want the full story.)
</p><p>
	So that’s when I started to see the music business from another side.
	Now I saw what it was like to be on the receiving end of your music.
	Now I was a major player inside the industry, friends with all those movers and shakers, hearing their perspective too.
</p><p>
	Also, I got to see thousands of musicians succeed.
	So I paid attention to what works.
</p><p>
	And that’s when I started writing the advice and observations in this book.
	Like a spy in the enemy’s camp, I was still an indie musician at heart, but giving you the report from the inside, telling my musician friends how to get in.
</p><p>
	I've been sharing these tips for years.
	And for what it's worth, when I asked my friend <a href="http://www.garyjules.com/">Gary Jules</a> how he got successful — (he had a #1 radio hit with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4N3N1MlvVc4">Mad World</a>”) — he said, “Man, I just followed your advice, that’s all!”
	So apparently these tips work.
</p><p>
	Now hold tight, and I’ll tell you absolutely everything I know.
</p>
