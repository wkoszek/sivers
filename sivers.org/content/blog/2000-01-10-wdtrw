<!-- Constantly ask what they really want -->
<p>
	Want to know the basic rule or marketing and promoting your music?
</p><p>
	With anyone you are trying to reach, <strong>constantly ask, “What do they really want?”</strong>
</p><p>
	Think hard, and don’t take this one lightly.
</p><p>
	Thinking of everything from the other person’s point of view is one of the best things you can do in life.
</p><p>
	Every time you write an email.
	Every time you lift up the phone.
	Every time you meet someone new.
</p><p>
	Think why people in the music industry are really working this job.
	Try to imagine them as just a well-meaning human being who is probably overworked, looking for a little happiness in the world, and likes music (or the music world itself) enough to do what they do, even though they could be doing something else.
</p><p>
	Think what their email inbox must look like, and how it would be unwise for you to send them an email with the subject of “hey” followed by a 7-page email detailing your wishes for success.
</p><p>
	Think what people are really looking for when they go out to a club to hear music.
	For some people, it’s just a way to be seen, to increase their popularity.
	For some, they’re searching for some music that does something completely original and mind-blowing.
	Some are looking for total visual entertainment.
</p><p>
	Nobody owes you their attention.
	Not your audience.
	Not a person you happened to call or email.
	Not even the music industry.
</p><p>
	Let go of your ego entirely.
<strong>
	Think of everything from their point of view.
</strong>
	Be their dream come true.
	Do what they really want.
</p><p>
	And maybe, just maybe, they’ll be or do what you really want.
