<!-- When communicating, be your quirky self -->
<p>
	When you contact people, stand apart from the crowd.
</p><p>
	If it sounds like they have a moment and aren’t in a major rush, entertain them a bit.
	Ask about their day and expect a real answer.
	Talk about something non-business for a minute or two.
</p><p>
	Or if they sound hectic, skip the “how are you”, skip the long introduction, ask your damn question and move out of the way.
	This means <strong>you must know your exact question before you contact them</strong>, just in case that ultra-quick situation is needed.
</p><p>
	Reach people like you would want to be reached.
	If you’re contacting fans, imagine what kind of communication you’d like to get.
	Something blunt and “just the facts”, or something a little twisted, creative, funny, entertaining and unique?
</p><p>
	This is a creative decision on your part.
<strong>
	Every contact with the people around your music (both fans and industry) is an extension of your art.
</strong>
	If you make depressing music, maybe you should send your fans a dark brown-and-black announcement that’s depressing just to look at.
	Set the tone.
	Pull in those people who love that kind of thing.
	<a href="/exclude">Proudly alienate</a> those that don’t.
</p><p>
	If you’re an in-your-face country-metal-speedpunk band, have the guts to call a potential booking agent and scream, “Listen you crazy dirtbag! I’m going to explode! Ah! Aaaaaaah!!!”
	If they like that introduction, you’ve found a good match.
</p><p>
	Be different.
	(Even if it’s just in your remarkable efficiency.)
</p><p>
	Everyone wants a little change in their day.
