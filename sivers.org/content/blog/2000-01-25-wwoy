<!-- Read about new music. Use the tricks that worked on you. -->
<p>
	Go to a website that writes about new music.
</p><p>
	You’ll read about, and see photos of, dozens of artists who you’ve never heard of before.
</p><p>
	Out of that whole site, only one or two will really catch your attention.
</p><p>
	Why?
	I don’t have the answer.
	Only you do.
	Ask yourself why a certain headline or photo or article caught your attention.
</p><p>
	Was it something about the opening sentence?
	Was it a curious tidbit about the background of the singer?
	What was it exactly that intrigued you?
</p><p>
	Analyze that.
	Use that.
	Adapt those techniques to try writing a headline or article about your music.
