<p>
	A person asks a musician, “What kind of music do you do?”
</p><p>
	The musician says, “All styles. Everything.”
</p><p>
	That person then asks, “So who do you sound like?”
</p><p>
	The musician says, “Nobody. We’re totally unique. Like nothing you’ve ever heard before.”
</p><p>
	Then what does that person do?
	Nothing!
	They might make a vague promise to check you out sometime.
	Then they walk on and forget about you.
	Why?
<strong>
	Becuase you didn’t arouse their curiosity!
	You violated a huge rule of self-promotion!
	Bad bad bad!
</strong>
</p><p>
	What if you had said, “It’s 70’s porno-funk music being played by men from Mars.”
</p><p>
	Or “It’s like a delicate little kiss on your earlobe from a pink-winged pixie.”
</p><p>
	Or “It’s deep-dancing reggae that magically creates palm trees and an ocean breeze wherever it is played, with grooves so deep it makes all non-dancers get drunk on the island vibe, and dance in the sand.”
</p><p>
	Any one of these, and you’ve got their interest.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Get yourself a magic key phrase that describes what you sound like.
</strong>
	Try out a few different ones, until you see which one always gets the best reaction from strangers.
	Use it.
	Have it ready at a moment’s notice.
</p><p>
	It doesn’t have to narrow what you do at all.
	Any of those three examples I use above could sound like anything.
</p><p>
	And that’s just the point.
<strong>
	If you have a magic phrase that describes your music in curious but vague terms, you can make total strangers start wondering about you.
</strong>
</p><p>
	But whatever you do, stay away from the words “everything”, “nothing”, “all styles”,  and “totally unique”.
</p><p>
	Say something!
