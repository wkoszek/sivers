<!-- Proudly exclude some people -->
<p>
	Proudly say what you’re not.
	“If you like Kanye West, you’ll hate us.”
	Then people who hate Kanye West will love that you said that, and give you a chance.
</p><p>
	You can’t please everyone in this world.
	Recklessly exclude people.
</p><p>
	Almost like you’re the doorman at an exclusive club that plays only your music.
	Maybe you wouldn’t allow anyone wearing a suit.
	Maybe you wouldn’t allow anyone without a suit!
</p><p>
	But know who you are, and have the confidence that somewhere out there, there’s a little niche of people that would like your kind of music.
	They may only be 1% of the population.
	But 1% of the world is 65 million people!
</p><p>
	Loudly leave out 99% of the world.
	When someone in your target 1% hears you excluding the part of the population they already feel alienated from, they’ll be drawn to you.
</p><p>
	Write down a list of artists who you don’t like, and whose fans probably wouldn’t like you.
	Use that.
