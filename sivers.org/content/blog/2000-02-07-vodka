<!-- The Most Expensive Vodka -->
<p>
	There is a vodka company that advertises itself as “The Most Expensive Vodka You Can Buy”.
</p><p>
	It’s an enticing.
	It’s almost a dare.
	(And it <a href="/exclude">proudly excludes people</a>!)
</p><p>
	While most companies are trying to be the cheapest, a few do the opposite, and aim to be the most expensive.
</p><p>
	Most people try to imitate current trends and styles.
	So I suggest you strongly declare that you are something totally un-trendy — the opposite of what everyone else is trying to be.
</p><p>
	Advertise your live show as “the most boring concert you’ll ever see.”
</p><p>
	Call your music “the most un-catchy, un-memorable, un-danceable music you’ve ever heard.”
</p><p>
	Tell the music industry “this music has no hit potential whatsoever.”
</p><p>
	I’ll bet you get their attention.
</p><p>
	It’s almost a dare.
