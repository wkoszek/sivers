<!-- Bad Targeting Example: progressive rocker targeting teenybopper -->
<p>
	On CD Baby, there was a great musician who made an amazing heavy-progressive-metal record.
</p><p>
	When we had a “search keywords” section, asking for three artists he sounds like, he wrote, “britney spears, ricky martin, jennifer lopez, backstreet boys, mp3, sex, free”
</p><p>
	What the hell was he thinking?
	He just wanted to turn up in people’s search engines, at any cost.
</p><p>
	But for what?
	And who?
</p><p>
	Did he really want a Britney Spears fan to get “tricked” into finding his dark-progressive-metal record?
	Would that 13-year-old girl actually spend the time to listen to his 10 minute epic, “Confusing Mysteries of Hell”?
	If she did, would she become a fan?
</p><p>
	I suggested he instead have the confidence to target the <em>real</em> fans of his music.
</p><p>
	He put three semi-obscure progressive artists into his search engine description instead, and guess what?
</p><p>
	He sold more music than ever!
	He found his true fans.
