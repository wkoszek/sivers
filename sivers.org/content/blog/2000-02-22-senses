<!-- Touch as many of their senses as you can -->
<p>
	The more senses you touch in someone, the more they’ll remember you.
</p><p>
	At best, it’s a live show, with you sweating right on top of them, the PA system pounding their chest, the smell of the stinky club, the flashing lights, and the visceral feeling of pushing up against strangers.
</p><p>
	At worst, it’s an email, a single web page, a mention in a post with no photo.
</p><p>
	Whenever possible, reach as many senses as possible.
	Have some amazing photos of yourself or your band, and convince every reviewer to put that photo next to the review of your music.
</p><p>
	Have videos for every song.
	Play live shows often.
	Aim to get people to hear your music instead of just hearing about it.
</p><p>
	Be a guest on every video-show you can.
	Scent your items with patchouli oil.
	Make your songs and productions truly emotional instead of merely catchy.
</p><p>
	(Touching their emotions is like touching their body. If you do it, you’ll be remembered.)
