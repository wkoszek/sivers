<!-- Never use corporate-speak -->
<p>
	Never use corporate marketing-speak.
</p><p>
	People don’t speak like that to their friends.
	People only speak that way to try to impress strangers, when feeling insecure.
</p><p>
	Your fans are your friends.
	Speak to them like real people.
</p><p>
	Be weird.
	Be a real person.
	Write every post or email as if it was from you to your best friend.
</p><p>
	This is a big reason why it’s so much cooler to be small and indie instead of big and corporate.
</p><p>
	Real people respond better to the weird, fun, quirky, and personal stuff.
