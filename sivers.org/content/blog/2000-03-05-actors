<!-- Imagine a play with 1000 actors on stage -->
<p>
	Imagine you’re in the audience of a play.
</p><p>
	Imagine there are one thousand actors on stage.
</p><p>
	Which ones would stand out?
	Which ones would you remember?
</p><p>
	It’s not always going to be the loudest or most hyperactive.
</p><p>
	Maybe you’d be drawn into the misty-blue woman with the long black hair in the deep blue cape with half her face hidden, standing silently at the edge of the stage.
</p><p>
	Now you, as a musician, are one of the actors on that overcrowded stage.
</p><p>
	Would you stand out?
	Would people remember you?
</p><p><strong>
	Be a strong enough version of you, so that people who want you can find you in the crowd.
</strong></p><p>
	(P.S. The most memorable actor on stage would be the one that gets off the stage, walks up to your seat, and gives you a kiss.)
