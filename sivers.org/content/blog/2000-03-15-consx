<!-- Even conservative legends were extreme -->
<p>
	Think of the legendary performers in that conservative old-fashioned style - the ones even your grandmother could like.
</p><p>
Frank Sinatra. Liberace. Judy Garland. Barbara Streisand.
</p><p>
	Even these conservative performers were rather extreme characters.
</p><p>
	Donâ€™t be afraid to be as extreme as you can imagine.
	Being in the spotlight is the excuse.
	You can get away with anything, all in the name of entertainment.
