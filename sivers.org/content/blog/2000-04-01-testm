<!-- Test. Improve. Perfect. Announce. -->
<p>
	In this indie music world, think in terms of “test marketing.”
</p><p>
	This is what food companies do before they release a new product.
	They release it just in Denver, for example, and see what people think of it there.
</p><p>
	They get feedback.
	They try a different name.
	They try an improved flavor, based on complaints or compliments.
	They try a different ad campaign.
	They see what works.
	Constantly improving.
</p><p>
	When it’s finally a success in Denver, they know they’re on to something good.
	They can now test it in Portland, Dallas, and Pittsburgh.
</p><p>
	When everyone seems to like it, they get the financial backing to “roll it out” and confidently spend a ton of money to distribute it around the whole country, or the whole world.
	The people investing money into it are confident, because it was a huge success in all the test markets.
</p><p>
	Think of what you’re doing with your music as test marketing.
</p><p>
	<strong>When you’re a huge success in a small area, then you can go to the big companies and ask for financial or resource help</strong> to “roll it out” to the country or world.
</p><p>
	Then they’ll feel confident that their big money is being well invested.
