<!-- A good plan wins no matter what happens -->
<p>
	Never make a plan that requires someone to come along with a magic wand.
</p><p>
	No investors. No financing. No record deal. No one giant client.
	If your plan requires any one of those, you need to make a better plan — one that will profit without the magic wand.
</p><p>
	Start now.
	Never wait.
</p><p>
	Your profits may be small, but sustainable.
	You can continue this way indefinitely.
	Grow your audience.
	Develop your skills.
	Build your reputation.
	Prove your staying power.
</p><p>
	You’ll be doing so well that you won’t need anyone’s help.
</p><p>
	Then if a deal is offered to you, you can take it or leave it.
	This means great negotiating power.
	You become a better investment when you don’t need their money.
	It shows that you’ll be successful whether they’re involved or not.
</p><p>
	So always make a plan that doesn’t require any investors or big deal.
	This plan wins no matter what happens.
