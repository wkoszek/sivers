<!-- Don’t be a mosquito -->
<p>
	A mosquito enters a room of people to suck something out of everyone.
</p><p>
	A mosquito doesn’t give anything back.
</p><p>
	People hate mosquitos.
</p><p>
	It’s important to meet people, but more important to get to know them.
	Ask questions.
	Listen.
</p><p>
	Learn what they love.
	Learn what they want.
	Make a point of discovering what you can do for them.
</p><p>
	Relationships are reciprocal.
	You need to give to receive.
</p><p>
	So don’t be a mosquito.
