<!-- Persistence is Polite -->
<p>
	As teenagers, we painfully learned that if you contact someone and they don’t contact you back, they’re just not into you.
	If you keep trying, you must be a total loser.
</p><p>
	But in the business world, it’s the opposite.
	Persistence is polite.
	If you <strong>don’t</strong> keep trying, you must be a loser.
</p><p>
	For example, imagine you are trying to contact me.
</p><ul><li>
	You send me a message on Facebook, but you don’t know that I never use Facebook.
</li><li>
	You email me, but it’s the day I’m leaving on an trip, so by the time I see it, it’s buried under other emails.
</li><li>
	You call and leave me a voicemail, but you don’t know that I never check voicemail.
</li><li>
	You text our mutual friend and ask if she’s heard from me.
	She tells you I’m on a trip.
</li><li>
	You email me again a week later.
</li><li>
	This time I see it, and I’m sincerely interested in talking with you, but just swamped in other things, so I don’t reply yet.
</li><li>
	Another week later, you call me, and this time I answer, saying, “Hi! So sorry I was hard to reach!”
</li></ul>
<p><strong>
	At this point, I am sincerely glad that you had the patience to keep trying to reach me, because I really did want to talk to you.
</strong></p><p><strong>
	Imagine this, instead:
</strong></p><ul><li>
	You send me a message on Facebook.
</li><li>
	I never see it.
</li><li>
	You silently rage for years, thinking I’m an asshole, thinking I hate you, so you hate me, too.
</li></ul><p><strong>
	Trying once, and never again, is rude and inconsiderate.
</strong></p><p>
	In this business, <strong>you have to prove that something is important to you</strong> by being persistent.
	If you send someone something, and don’t follow-up until you reach them, it means you didn’t care.
</p><p>
	Persistence is polite because it shows that you understand that everyone is busy, and it’s nothing against you.
