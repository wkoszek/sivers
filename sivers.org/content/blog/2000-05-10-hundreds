<!-- Stay in close touch with hundreds of people -->
<p>
	Every person you’ve ever met has a huge potential to help you.
</p><p>
	If you keep in touch, and stay on their mind, there is a big chance they will send an opportunity your way.
	But if you don’t keep in touch, that potential is almost gone.
	Out of touch, out of mind.
</p><p>
	So you need to make a habit, a simple automatic system, to keep in touch without relying on your memory.
	Use a “contact manager” app to label everyone in a category like this:
</p><ul><li>
	<strong>A</strong>: very important people.
	Contact every three weeks.
</li><li>
	<strong>B</strong>: important people.
	Contact every five weeks.
</li><li>
	<strong>C</strong>: most people.
	Contact every few months.
</li><li>
	<strong>D</strong>: everyone else.
	Contact once a year, to make sure you still have their correct info.
</li></ul><p>
	Contact them just to say hello.
	Ask what’s new.
	Find out how things are going with them.
	See if you can help them in any way.
</p><p>
	Don’t ask a favor unless you’ve already been in touch recently.
	It’s a little insulting to contact someone you haven’t talked with in a long time, just to ask a favor.
	This regular contact should be unselfish, sincerely caring how they are.
</p><p>
	Most people are so bad at keeping in touch that they will really appreciate that you do.
	And if you make this a system, it’s really not hard to stay in close touch with hundreds of people.
