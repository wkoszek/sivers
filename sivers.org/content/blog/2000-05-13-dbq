<!-- Get used to the idea of database and quantity -->
<p>
	If you want any level of success beyond the admiration of friends and family, you need to stay in close touch with hundreds, and ideally, thousands of people.
	That means everyone: fans, artists, agents, and the endless characters you’re going to encounter around the world on your way to the top.
	<strong>You need to keep track of them all.</strong>
</p><p>
	You need a database - a “contact manager” - which is like an address book, but with tags, history, and more.
	It takes a discipline and orderliness you may not be used to.
	But it comes in so handy when you need to contact that graphic designer who introduced himself to you once three years ago after a gig in Seattle, or to be able to instantly find the six drummers you know in southern California.

	Get used to this concept, and we’ll go into detail on <a href="/dbt">the database tips page</a>.
