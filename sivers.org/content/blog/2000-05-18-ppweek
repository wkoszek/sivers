<!-- Meet three new people every week -->
<p>
	One of the best books about the music business was called “Making It in the New Music Business” by James Riordan.
</p><p>
	He suggested that, as an aspiring musician (or producer/agent/writer/etc.) - you make a point to <strong>meet three new people in the music industry every week</strong>.
</p><p>
	Imagine that!
	Three new people every single week - people that could actually help your career!
	In a year from now you’ll have relationships with over 150 new people that are potential “lottery tickets” - and hopefully the interest is <a href="/mosquito">mutual</a>.
</p><p><strong>
	The thing is, you have to develop these relationships.
</strong></p><p>
	Put them on your <a href="/hundreds">A, B, or C list</a>.
	<a href="/kit1">Stay in touch</a>.
	Go beyond the introduction, and really get to know these people, what they’re looking for in business and life, what they’re interested in, and <a href="/hych">how you can help them</a>.
