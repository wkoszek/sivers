<!-- Always think how you can help someone -->
<p>
	As you’re meeting all of these people in your life and career, always keep in mind how you can help them.
	You should practically meditate on it before contacting them.
</p><p>
	Someone you know is just who they’re looking for.
	Some resource you’ve got would make their day.
	There’s always favor you can do.
</p><p>
	An article you read in this morning’s news might be of particular interest to someone you met last summer, so look them up and send it to them.
	A film/TV music supervisor might mention she’s getting married and is looking for a reggae band.
	You don’t do reggae, but with your database you can help her find a great band that does.
</p><p>
	Maybe you spent three weeks shopping for a laptop.
	Maybe a booking agent you met today mentioned that he’s looking for a new laptop.
	Email him the best info you found.
</p><p>
	Give give give, and sometimes you will receive.
