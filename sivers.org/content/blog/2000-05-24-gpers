<!-- Get personal -->
<p>
	Some people, out of the thousands I know, actually contact me on a regular basis.
</p><p>
	Some of those always stick with a strict business script when they call:
	“Hi I’m calling to check in to see how sales are doing, if you need more inventory, how things are going.”
</p><p>
	But others seem to have the gift of smalltalk.
	I don’t know how they do it, but soon we’re talking about my girlfriend, their dogs, peanut butter, high school, Japan, and something that happened on the way to work today.
</p><p>
	Now - <strong>when an opportunity comes up to help someone</strong> — say for example a film/TV person asks me “who’s good in that standard rock genre?” — <strong>guess who comes to mind first?</strong>
</p><p>
	The person who hasn’t departed from the standard business call, or the person who went beyond?
</p><p><strong>
	Be a real person.
	Be a friend.
</strong></p><p>
	<strong>Don’t always be selling yourself.</strong>
	You’ll be like that annoying uncle who shows up at the family reunion to try to sell everyone on life insurance.
</p><p>
	Have the confidence to know that being a cool person, being a friend, will sell you more than being a pushy salesperson.
</p><p><strong>
	People do business with people they like. With their friends, whenever possible.
