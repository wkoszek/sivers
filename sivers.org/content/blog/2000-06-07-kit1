<!-- Keep in touch -->
<p><strong>
	Quite often, the difference between success and failure is just a matter of keeping in touch.
</strong></p>
<p>
	There are some amazing musicians who sent their music to CD Baby, and when I heard it, I flipped.
	A few times, I stopped what I was doing and called them to tell them I thought they were a total genius.
</p><p>
	Twice I left a voicemail, and guess what?
	They didn’t call back!
	What masochistic success-sabotaging kind of thing is that to do?
</p><p>
	A week later I had forgotten about their music, since so much new music came in.
</p><p>
	If they would have just called back, and kept in touch, they would have had a huge fan at a large music company — a fan that would go out on a limb to help their career in ways others just dream of.
	But they never kept in touch, and now I can’t remember their names.
</p><p>
	On the other hand, there are other musicians whose music didn’t really catch my attention the first time around, but they kept in touch so well that I often find myself helping them more as a friend than a fan.
</p><p>
	Keep in touch, keep in touch, keep in touch!
</p><p>
	People forget you very fast.
