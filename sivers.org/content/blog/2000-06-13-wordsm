<!-- Why words matter more than ever -->
<p>
	On the radio, your music speaks for itself.
	People hear your music and decide if they like it.
	No words were needed to describe it.
</p><p>
	In concert, your music speaks for itself.
	Watching you perform, people appreciate your style as an artist.
	No words needed.
</p><p>
	But on the internet, and in conversation, words matter a lot.
</p><p>
	When people have not yet heard your music, your <strong>words describing your music</strong> have to be so good that it makes people go to the trouble of hearing your music.
</p><p>
	Online, the words need to <strong>make them go click the links</strong> to hear it.
</p><p>
	In conversation, the words need to <strong>make them remember</strong> enough to go hear you later.
</p><p>
	It’s a big job, but since these are the ways you’re going to call attention to your music (until you’re on every radio/TV outlet in the world), you need to <strong>learn how to describe your music</strong>.
	It’s not that hard, and it’s very important.
