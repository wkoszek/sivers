<!-- Tell people why they should care -->
<p>
	When asked, most musicians say, “We don’t sound like anyone.”
	Or when asked what kind of music they play, say, “You can’t describe it. Just check it out.”
</p><p>
	That’s a lazy, inconsiderate, stupid mistake.
	Think of it from the other person’s point of view.
</p><p>
	Imagine you saw someone with a business card that said, “President -  Some Company, Inc.”
</p><p>
	You say, “What kind of business do you do?”
</p><p>
	They say, “Oh, I don’t know. It’s not like anything. I can’t describe it.  You’ll just have to check it out!  We’re about 20 minutes down that road, and we’re only open next Thursday from 11 to 12 at night.”
</p><p>
	Would you really get in your car and spend a Thursday night to check it out, if they couldn’t even tell you why you should?
	No?
	So how do you expect someone to come to your gig?
</p><p>
	You have to convince people!
	Grab their curiosity.
	Describe what you actually do in an interesting way.
</p><p>
	Make the wheels in their head turn.
	Make them taste it, hear it, see it, want it.
</p><p>
	Anyone who asks what kind of music you do is giving you a chance to impress them.
	Take the opportunity.
