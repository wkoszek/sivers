<!-- Describe your music like a non-musician -->
<p>
	When describing your music, don’t be a musician.
</p><p>
	Don’t say, “Wonderful harmonies and intricate arrangements. A tight rhythm section and introspective lyrics!”
</p><p>
	Real people don’t even understand what that means.
	That’s musician speak.
</p><p>
	Think what an office-worker would say to a friend about your music:
</p><p>
	“It’s cute!  I love that song with the little ‘hoop-hoop!’ at the beginning, with that baby voice.  It’s kinda funky!  And he’s got this sexy bedroom voice.  Cool video.”
</p><p>
	Think what one teenager down at the mall would say to another, when describing what they love about your music:
</p><p>
	“Dude, it’s like if Kranetow hadn’t wimped out. It’s like Tweetown went metal, but they’re from Mars or somethin. It’s slammin. That chick’s voice is insane!”
</p><p>
	Real people often compare an artist to other famous artists.
	Real people talk about the overall “vibe” or sound of something.
</p><p>
	Real people don’t talk about “insightful lyrics” and “wonderful harmonies” and “tight musicianship”.
	That’s musician-speak.
</p><p>
	Play your music for some non-musicians, and ask them what they’d say to a friend about it.
</p><p>
	The way you describe your music should be almost as exciting (or touching, or sad, or shocking) as the music itself.
</p><p>
	If you describe your music in ways that reach people’s emotion and imagination, then your music itself will be more likely to reach and touch people.
