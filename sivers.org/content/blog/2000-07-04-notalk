<!-- Or you can not talk at all -->
<p>
	Words got you down?
	Nothing new to say?
</p><p>
	Spend some money on a great photographer.

	Calvin Klein showed you don’t have to talk and talk and talk.
</p><p>
	But if you don’t, it’s all up to the image.

	Unless you’re a household name, it’s hard for people to hear your music without trying.
	They have to go seek you out, and make an effort to listen.
</p><p>
	Music is like perfume.
	You have to convince and persuade people, with your words and images, to take that initiative, to make an effort, to listen your music.
</p><p>
	If you try to just “let the music speak for itself” most people will never hear you.
