<!-- Basic online skills you must know -->
<p>
	Before you continue, please do everything in this list of important basic skills.
</p>
<h2>
	Email
</h2>
<ul><li>
	Go into your email settings, and make sure you <strong>have a signature</strong>.
	It should say who, what, and where, with a few URLs.
	Example:
<pre>
--
Maya Danubé, fragrant jazz bass clarinet, New York City
http://mayadanube.com  me@mayadanube.com  (917)611-5310
Watch & listen: https://www.youtube.com/user/mayadanube
Friend me, baby: https://www.facebook.com/mayadanube
</pre>
</li><li>
	Make a <strong>descriptive subject</strong>.
	Never “hey” or “booking”.
	Try “Available June 6 for showcase?” or “introduction to photographer”.
	This is considerate.
	Now when your email is one of hundreds in an inbox, it will say exactly what is contained inside, from the other person’s point of view.
</li><li>
	Make it <strong>as short as possible</strong>.
	The shorter your email, the more likely it will be read and replied to.
	Be direct.
	Five sentences is ideal.
	If your email is too long, they are likely to procrastinate, and never get back to it.
</li><li>
	Use short paragraphs.
	Leave plenty of space.
	Reading a screen is different from reading a book.
	Avoid that huge book-size paragraph block of text.
</li></ul>
<h2>
	Database Skills
</h2>
<ul><li>
	Learn all the features of your database program.
	(If you don’t have one, <a href="https://highrisehq.com/">Highrise</a> is good.)
	Know to find people by tags and skills, then add, remove, and change their info.
</li><li>
	Go through all your contacts once per year to make sure they’re current.
</li><li>
	Ideally, track each contact you have with someone: each call, email, and visit.
	It helps when someone from a year ago calls you up saying, “It’s George!  Remember?”
	Then you can say, “Oh yeah! Last time we spoke you were applying for a grant. How did that go?”
</li></ul>
<h2>
	Web Skills
</h2>
<ul><li>
	Know your social media URLs.
	Telling someone to go search for you is like telling them to look up your phone number in the phone book.
	Instead, know your exact URLs (twitter.com/yourname, facebook.com/yourname) so you can give it to people directly.
	If you don’t, they’ll probably never bother to go search for you.
</li><li>
	Know how to make an MP3.
	Give it a good filename like YOUR_NAME-Song_Title.mp3  (not Untitled01.mp3)
	Edit the ID3 tags to put your full name and URL in the info, so whoever has this MP3 knows who it is and how to find you.
