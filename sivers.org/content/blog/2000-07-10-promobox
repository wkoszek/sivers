<!-- Promo bits, ready to copy -->
<p>
	This one action will be one of the most useful time-saving, opportunity-creating things you’ve ever done:
</p><p>
	Prepare, in advance, all of the things that people and sites ask for when you’re self-promoting.
</p><p>
	Make a folder on your computer called “promo” and put these things inside for quick easy access:
</p>
<ul><li>
	<strong>MP3s of your best songs.</strong>
	Give each one a nice long name, without spaces, so that if anyone runs across it on the web they know who it is.
	(YourName-TheSongTitle.mp3)
</li><li>
	<strong>An entertaining bio written four times, in four different lengths:</strong>
<ol><li>
	Long bio. Over three paragraphs, 1-2 pages, exhaustive and rarely used.
</li><li>
	Medium length bio. 2-4 paragraphs. The top end of what people will sit and read online.
</li><li>
	Short bio. One great paragraph.
</li><li>
	One-liner. One great sentence.
</ol>
</li><li>
	<strong>Quotes from reviews:</strong>
<ol><li>
	One big text file with every review you’ve ever received, all typed out and credited.
</li><li>
	One text file with just the best short quotes from these reviews.
</ol>
</li><li>
	<strong>Graphics, with a few different sizes of each:</strong>
<ol><li>
	artist photos  (studio shot, live shot, up close, far away)
</li><li>
	album art graphics (big version, small version)
</li><li>
	your logo, if you have one
</ol>
</li></ul>
<p>
	If you do this, just once, then the job of uploading your information to another website will be painless.
	You can jump on every little opportunity that comes along.
</p><p>
	Bonus points if you have your own website, and put all of this stuff on a “promo” page on your site, so anyone else can get it all from one place, too.
