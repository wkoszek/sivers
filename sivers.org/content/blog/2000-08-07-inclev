	If you’re putting your fans to work, let them know they’re on the “inside family” now.

	No need to make specific promises.
	It’s a feeling more than a contract.

	Same with your casual fans and email list.
	Make them part of an exclusive club.
	Bring them inside.

	Everybody wants to be able to say they hung out with ____(your name here)_____ when she was just playing little clubs in her hometown, and now look at her!
