<!-- Stay In Over Your Head -->
<p>
	Stay in over your head.
</p><p>
	“Over your head” is a slang phrase, referring to being in water that is over your head, too deep to stand, and therefore too much to handle.
</p><p>
	But for growth, that’s the place to be.
</p><p>
	Whatever you’re doing in your life right now, if it’s become a routine, it’s time to move on to something new and scary.
</p><p>
	Abraham Maslow wrote, “Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth): <strong>Make the growth choice a dozen times a day</strong>.”
</p><p>
	Whatever scares you, go do it.
