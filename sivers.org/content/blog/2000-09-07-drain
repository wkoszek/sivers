<!-- If this is draining your energy, please stop! -->
<p>
	My favorite slogan is “Whatever scares you, go do it.”
</p><p>
	If something scares you, that’s another version of being excited.
	If it excites you, it’s giving you energy, and that’s always good.
</p><p>
	But if something is making you miserable and draining your energy, please stop.
	Life is telling you that is not the path for you.
</p><p>
	For a quick example, look at one of my biggest mistakes:
</p><p>
	My band was doing well.
	A well-meaning lawyer that I trusted told me that I should start a record label.
</p><p>
	“Find and sign 3 other artists.
	Do for them what you did for your band.
	Then sell the whole label for a million bucks!”
</p><p>
	I walked out of his office with slumped shoulders, miserable, saying, “Yeah… I guess he’s right.”
</p><p>
	With a long face, I plopped in a chair back home and thought, “Oh man... do I really have to do this?”
	But because I trusted him, I spent two years of my life trying!
</p><p>
	It wasn’t what came natural to me, so of course it was a failure.
	And since I had spent so much time on it, the thing that I was good at, making music, was being ignored!
</p><p>
	I wish I would have paid attention to my lack of enthusiasm, and stuck with the things that excited me.
</p><p>
	Please don’t make the same mistake.
</p><p>
	If anything I’m talking about here makes you tired instead of wired, just <strong>don’t do it!</strong>
	Stick with what excites you.
	That’s where you’ll find your success.
