<!-- Compass in Your Gut -->
<p>
	I consider this the most important lesson I ever learned.
</p><p>
	For years I let smart people talk me into things that just weren’t right for me.
	I’ll bet you have, too.
	I went down wrong paths, doing things I wasn’t excited about, because someone or something convinced me it was what I “should” be doing.
</p><p>
	Then I finally figured out something that’s made all the difference, and I’ve been happier and more successful since:
</p><p>
	There’s a compass in your gut that points two directions : <strong>exciting</strong> and <strong>draining</strong>.
</p><p>
	No matter what advice anyone gives you — no matter how smart the person telling you what to do — you need to let this compass override your other decisions.
</p><p>
	Whatever <strong>excites</strong> you, go do it.
</p><p>
	Whatever <strong>drains</strong> you, stop doing it.
</p><p>
	For example: Many musicians get into music because they love playing their instrument.
	They love it so much they want to do it for a living.
	But then well-meaning advice-givers say, “If you’re going to be in the music business, you have to read this book on music business law.
	And you have to learn networking skills, and marketing, and accounting, and writing good newsletters, and blah blah blah....”
</p><p>
	Soon the musicians are spending all their time doing everything but playing their instrument, and decide it’s not worth it!
	They give up, get a dumb job, and lose interest in their instrument, because a career in music now seems tedious and overwhelming.
</p><p>
	But <strong>nothing is worth losing your enthusiasm</strong>. Nothing!
</p><p>
	Whatever <strong>excites</strong> you, go do it.
	Whatever <strong>drains</strong> you, stop doing it.
	You have to pay close attention to that compass, even in little day-to-day decisions.
</p><p>
	You get offered a gig.
	They’re on the phone waiting for an answer.
	Is it exciting you or draining you?
</p><p>
	You hear about some new technology.
	People say you need to check out this new app.
	Is it exciting you or draining you?
</p><p>
	<strong>If it doesn’t excite you, don’t do it.</strong>
	There’s almost nothing that you <strong>must</strong> do.
</p><p>
	<strong>Whatever drains you, someone somewhere is excited about doing.</strong>
	<strong>Find them and let them do it.</strong>
</p><p>
	Work towards this ideal, and soon you’ll be doing only what excites you the most, all day.
	Then you’ll find that doors open for you, opportunities come your way, and life seems to go easier, because you’re doing what you’re meant to do.
