<!-- Ideas are just a multiplier of execution -->
<p>
	It’s so funny when I hear people being so protective of ideas.
	People who want me to sign an NDA to tell me the simplest idea.
</p><p>
	To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed.
	They are just a multiplier.
	Execution is worth millions.
</p><p>
	Explanation:
</p>
<table class="realtable">
<tr><td>
	AWFUL IDEA
</td><td>= -1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	WEAK IDEA
</td><td>= 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	SO-SO IDEA
</td><td>= 5</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GOOD IDEA
</td><td>= 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GREAT IDEA
</td><td>= 15</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	BRILLIANT IDEA
</td><td>= 20</td></tr>
<tr><td>--------</td><td>---------</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	NO EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	WEAK EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	SO-SO EXECUTION
</td><td>= $10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GOOD EXECUTION
</td><td>= $100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GREAT EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	BRILLIANT EXECUTION
</td><td>= $10,000,000</td></tr>
</table>

<strong>
	To make a business, you need to multiply the two.
</strong>
</p><p>
	The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20.
</p><p>
	The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000.
</p><p>
	That’s why I don’t want to hear people’s ideas.
</p><p>
	I’m not interested until I see their execution.
