<!-- Happy 10th Birthday to CD Baby - and an announcement -->
<p>
	I started CD Baby 10 years ago this week - in March 1998.
</p><p>
	I’m just a musician-geek, not a business-man.
	Never meant to start a company.
	I was just selling my own CD, then helped some friends do it, then it accidently turned into CD Baby.
	(Ooops!)
</p><p>
	Now CD Baby has paid over $70 million dollars directly to musicians.
	And despite the moaning you hear from the major labels, independent artists are selling better than ever.
	Even physical CD sales are up 30% over last year!
</p><h3>
	Announcement:
</h3><p>
	For the past 10 years I’ve spent most waking hours, 7 days a week, doing nothing but CD Baby.
	Last year I just slept on the couch at the office for 6 months, usually working from 7am to midnight.
</p><p>
	So today seems like a good day to tell you that <strong>I don’t work at CD Baby anymore, and haven’t in months</strong>.
</p><p>
	I’m still the owner, but haven’t been to the office since May.
	The crew there is running things better than I ever could.
	They know more than I do, and do a better job.
</p><p>
	I’ve made that transition from self-employed to business-owner.
	(You know you’re a true business-owner when you can leave your business for a year, and come back to find it’s doing much better than when you left.)
</p><p>
	Why am I telling you this?
</p><p>
	Because the reason I freed my time is to find more ways to help you.
</p><p>
	Helping you develop, create, promote, and sell your music makes me happier than anything.
	It’s still why I bounce out of bed in the morning.
</p><p>
	I love it even more than making my own music.
	By helping you get your music out to the world, and helping you make a living doing it, I feel that in a way I’m making more music than ever.
</p><p>
	There are many ways I can help you, but I’ll email you about those next week.
</p><p>
	Today was just a CD Baby birthday announcement.
	Still, I wanted to let you know there are exciting things to come.
