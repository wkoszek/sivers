<!-- Never have a limit on your income -->
<p>
	A <a href="http://www.harveker.com/">wise man</a> said, “<strong>Never have a limit on your income</strong>.”
</p><p>
	Example he gave:
</p><p>
	If you sell pens for a living and someone orders a million pens, no problem!
	You just place an order with your manufacturer for a million pens, get them to the customer, and celebrate.
</p><p>
	But if you do hands-on massage for a living and a recent spot on Oprah gets you a waiting list of 10,000 people, “you’ll wish you were in the pen business.”
</p><p>
	Point being :
<strong>
	If you make a living only providing an in-person (hands-on) service, you are limiting your income.
</strong>
	If you were in a “while you sleep” business, there is no limit to how much you can make.
</p><p>
	So... what about musicians?
</p><p>
	Recently, some people suggest that the recorded music is now just a free giveaway to get people to go to the show.
	They say that musicians are only in a hands-on service-provider business now.
</p><p>
	But you can see the flaw in this plan.
	As a musician, you must not buy into that “only earn by performing” belief because <strong>it limits your income</strong>.
</p><p><strong>
	What other ways can music be a “while you sleep” income-earner for musicians?
</strong></p>
<ul><li>
	write songs for others to perform
</li><li>
	creating commercial-use music (that businesses will use in advertising, for example)
</li><li>
	getting your music into film/tv
</li><li>
	paid-area access to your web-archive with all your music, even works-in-progress
</li><li>
	make it easy for fans to donate
</li><li>
	create a recognizable brand once, then license the name or model to others (like “Chicken Soup for the Soul”)
</li><li>
	franchise your band: train multiple bands how to sound just like you, then all can go tour, while you get royalty when they do
</li><li>
	creating music-education programs used by many schools
</li><li>
	release your unmixed tracks for fans to remix, letting them sell the remixes on a 50/50 split
</li></ul>
<p>
	Whatever income ideas you’re thinking, make sure you’re being paid for more than just your time.
