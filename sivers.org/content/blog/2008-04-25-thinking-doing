<!-- Eliminating the time between thinking something and doing it -->
<p>
	I admire people that experiment with their own life.
</p><p>
	People like marathon runner <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/01/ultraman/">Dean Karnazes</a>, memory expert <a href="http://www.wired.com/2008/04/ff-wozniak/">Piotr Wozniak</a>, and optimized superman <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/">Tim Ferriss</a>, for example.
</p><p>
	I’ve been experimenting with eliminating procrastination.
	I'm trying to take all the “some day” and “maybe” things, and just do them.
</p><p>
	The two rules that help are:
</p><ol><li>
	“<a href="/scares-excites-do-it">Whatever scares you, go do it.</a>”
</li><li>
	“<a href="/tvtest">Let's see what happens.</a>”
</ol><p>
	It feels great to eliminate the time between thinking something and doing it.
