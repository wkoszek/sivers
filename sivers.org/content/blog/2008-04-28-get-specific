<!-- Get specific! -->
<p>
	One of the most common things I hear my musician friends say is, “We’re looking for a booking agent.”
</p><p>
	I reply, “Who?”
</p><p>
	They say, “Uh... what?”
</p><p>
	“Which booking agent are you looking for?  What’s their name?”
</p><p>
	“But... we don’t know!”
</p><p><strong>
	“How do you expect to find someone if you don’t even know their name?”
</strong></p><p>
	It’s not hard to find the answer to anything.
</p><p>
	What venue do you want to play?
	Contact them and ask which booking agents they use.
</p><p>
	What band do you want to emulate?
	Contact them and ask who their booking agent is.
</p><p>
	Once you find the person’s name, voila - you’re no longer looking for a booking agent.
	You found them, and it only took a few minutes.
</p><p>
	Yes I’m being a smart-ass, but trying to help.
</p><p><strong>
	Whenever you find you’re aiming for something you haven’t defined, get specific!
</strong></p><p>
	It’s amazing how that one step turns goals from impossible into easy.
</p>
<h3>
	Examples:
</h3>
	If you need to hire someone to help you, get specific about what they would do.
	Write down a list of what you need them to do.
	Then write down how they would do those things.
</p><p>
	If you need to get your music out there, get specific about where it should be.
	Should it be in TV shows?
	Which one?
	Find out who chooses music for that TV show, and contact them.
</p><p>
	Over the years, I’ve found that turning a vague desire into a specific action is one of the most motivating things I’ve ever done.
