<!-- Restrictions will set you free -->
<p>
	Someone says, "Write me a piece of music. Anything. No restrictions. Go!"
</p><p>
	You’re stumped.
	The blank page syndrome.
</p><p>
	Instead, someone says, "Write me a piece of music using only a flute, saw, and this broken toy piano.  You can only use the notes D, E, and B - but never all three at the same time.  It has to be in 3/4 time, start quiet, get loud, then get quiet by the end.  Go!"
</p><p>
	Aha!
	Now you’re cookin’!
</p><p>
	For creative inspiration, give yourself restrictions.
