<!-- Selling music by solving a specific need -->
<p>
	Someone asked me how they could sell more of their instrumental music.
</p><p>
	For instrumental music, it sells best if you <strong>tie it into a purpose</strong>.
</p><p>
	Massage music sells very well.
</p><p>
	Yoga music sells very well.
</p><p>
	Instrumental Christmas music sells very well. 
</p><p>
	Notice they’re selling <strong>more than just the music itself</strong>.
	They’re selling something that non-music people find useful.
<strong>
	They solve a problem.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Now imagine two candlemakers.
</p><p>
	One says, “My candles have only the finest wax with the best quality wick!”
</p><p>
	The other says, “These are prayer candles. Light one whenever you pray.”
</p><p>
	There are dozens of people who will buy the first. 
</p><p>
	But there are <strong>millions</strong> who will buy the second.
