<!-- Action-Reaction -->
<p>
	For every action there is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion">equal and opposite reaction</a>.
</p><p>
	Some were worried that short-attention-span entertainment from YouTube would diminish attention spans.
	But 50-hour-long dramas like Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, or Walking Dead are <a href="http://www.wired.com/2007/03/snacklash/">more popular than ever</a>.
</p><p>
	Every abundance creates a <a href="http://www.longtail.com/the_long_tail/2008/04/seth-godin-asks.html">new scarcity</a>.
</p><p>
	Every time someone complains about how things are changing, remember that change leaves room for its opposite reaction, too.
</p><p>
	Let’s think of some examples, shall we?
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
	ACTION:
	More and more and more music to choose from.
</dt><dd>
	REACTION:
	More need for tastemakers to tell us what’s good.
</dd>
<dt>
	ACTION:
	Less venues for musicians to play.
</dt><dd>
	REACTION:
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_concert">House concerts</a>.
</dd>
<dt>
	ACTION:
	Too much email.
</dt><dd>
	REACTION:
	Popularity of other methods like Facebook message, WhatsApp, and Slack.
</dd>
<dt>
	ACTION:
	The push to make recorded music free.
</dt><dd>
	REACTION:
	Paying artists directly, with <a href="https://www.patreon.com/">Patreon</a>, <a href="http://www.pledgemusic.com/">PledgeMusic</a>, and other crowd-funding.
</dd>
	ACTION:
	Social network, where hundreds of people you’ve never met are called “friends”.
</dt><dd>
	REACTION:
	Anti-social network, a secret site where you can’t see who else is on there unless you’ve privately communicated a shared password.  Then your “friends” can be your real friends, and you can have a better (private) conversation.  <em>(No this doesn’t exist yet, but that’s part of the fun of this action-reaction thing : using it to imagine what should exist.)</em>
</dd></dl>
<p>
	The chief economist at Google <a href="http://freakonomics.com/2008/02/25/hal-varian-answers-your-questions/">said</a>, “If you are looking for a career where your services will be in high demand, you should find something where you provide a scarce, complementary service to something that is getting ubiquitous and cheap. So what’s getting ubiquitous and cheap? And what is complementary to that?”
