<!-- Ah, to own nothing! -->
<p>
	Something’s changed.
	I just can’t get myself to buy anything.
</p><p>
	I’m writing this on a 7-year-old laptop.
	It works.
</p><p>
	I’ve been wearing the same few pieces of clothing for years.
	They’re fine.
</p><p>
	It’s not just about personal clutter.
	Every manufactured thing creates a <a href="http://storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-stuff/">ton of waste</a> just to make.
	Unless I really desperately need something, I don’t want to add to that waste.
</p><p>
	And if your money is <a href="http://www.geekculture.com/joyoftech/joyarchives/1125.html">invested</a> instead of spent on unnecessary things, it really adds up to more freedom in the future.
</p><p>
	Plus, I’ve been <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/2007/07/11/how-to-travel-the-world-with-10-pounds-or-less-plus-how-to-negotiate-convertibles-and-luxury-treehouses/">living out of a backpack</a> for much of the year.
	So I judge every item harshly, as a major burden, that better have a damn good reason why I should carry it around with me everywhere as I travel.
</p><p>
	Wouldn’t it be more fun to never have to own anything, but to just have it when you need it?
