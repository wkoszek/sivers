<!-- Bye-Bye, Baby! -->
<p>
	There’s a beautiful quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maslow">Abraham Maslow</a>:
	“Life is an ongoing process of choosing between safety (out of fear and need for defense) and risk (for the sake of progress and growth). Make the growth choice a dozen times a day.”
</p><p>
	Last March I <a href="/bilbo">announced</a> that I haven’t worked at CD Baby since last year.
	In fact I’ve hardly been there since 2002.
	I designed all the internal systems to run without me, so that I could be free to go learn and invent new things.
</p><p>
	But now my new projects are exciting me so much that I decided to hand over CD Baby to someone that’s going to make it better than ever for you.
	I chose <a href="http://www.discmakers.com/">Disc Makers</a> as the new owner because I've known their president for years, and I always felt they’d do a better job of running CD Baby than I would.
</p><p>
	The CD Baby staff, location, name, and everything else will stay the same, but I think you’ll start to notice more attention given to improvements that help you sell more music.
</p><p>
	So, this isn’t big news.
	Just letting you know that CD Baby is in better hands now, and I’m off to new things.
