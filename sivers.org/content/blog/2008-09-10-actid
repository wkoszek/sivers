<!-- Small actions changing self-identity -->
<p>
	Have you noticed how a small action can change your self-identity?
</p><p>
	Last week when I was learning scuba diving in Iceland, I took a snorkeling trip to my dive spot first.
	The snorkelers did everything the divers did, minus the tank and weights.
</p><p>
	So a week later, when I returned to dive for real, I felt a little like an assistant teacher.
	I was helping the other tourists who had never been there before, showing them where to go, and helping them rinse their masks.
</p><p>
	Even though the day before, I wasn’t very confident about my diving skills — I had just got my scuba certification that day — <strong>taking on this role of assistant-teacher made me feel a bit like an expert</strong>.
	By the time I got in the water, I was confident and excited.
	An hour later, I helped a panic-stricken diver get to the surface, really cementing this feeling.
</p><p><strong>
	I think back about the other tiny actions that changed my self-identity.
</strong></p>
<ul><li>
	When I was 17, I met <a href="/kimo">Kimo Williams</a>, who taught me <a href="/berklee">I could graduate college in 2 years</a>, which gave me an identity as an overachiever.
</li><li>
	When I joined the circus at 18, I was unable to sleep in moving vehicles, so I became the designated driver of the circus truck.
<strong>
	Having this role made me feel in charge, so I acted in charge, so I became in charge.
</strong>
	After used to being the leader in this small way, I ended up being band-leader of all my bands after that, then starting my own company.
	It just felt like, “Well, that’s who I am.”
	But how much of that was due to a decision to drive the circus truck?
</li><li>
	When I was 22, my girlfriend’s hippie parents — and the book “<a href="/book/Island">Island</a>” by Aldous Huxley — inspired me to quit my safe and happy job, and to never have a job again.
	I was now an entrepreneur, committed to creating a living from my own ventures.
</li></ul>
<p>
	Well, maybe that last one wasn’t small, but the one action of quitting my job became some kind of proof that <strong>I’m the type that avoids my comfort zone to step into the unknown</strong>.
</p><p>
	Recently, when I quit my company and was riding a scooter around Vietnam, a long-lost friend called out of the blue.
	When I told him what I was doing he just said, “Yep. That sounds like you!”
</p><p>
	Based on what?
</p><p>
	A series of small actions I’ve taken along the way, I guess.
	I could have just as easily made a single different decision earlier at 17, and be married with kids teaching guitar lessons in Chicago quite happily.
</p>
<ul><li>
	Talking to a beautiful stranger.
</li><li>
	Helping someone in need.
</li><li>
	Starting a band.
</li></ul>
<p>
	Like those life-changing coincidences — (how did you meet your spouse?) — taking a small action can snowball into huge changes that create a new you.
