<!-- Mastering entrepreneurship? -->
<p>
	After reading the book “<a href="/book/ArtOfLearning">The Art of Learning</a>”, I was thinking of mastery : committing yourself to years of achieving mastery of one single thing.
</p><p>
	My first thought was computer programming, but that didn’t feel fulfilling enough.
	I enjoy it, but only as a means to a different goal.
</p><p>
	Then I realized I could really commit myself to a lifetime mastery of entrepreneurship.
	It satisfies me on every level - much more for personal and altruistic reasons than financial.
</p><p><strong>
	But what the hell is mastery of entrepreneurship?
</strong>
	Starting one successful company?
	Ten?
	Or is it something else entirely?
	There’s no championship and no finish line.
</p><p>
	If entrepreneurship is about creating a new company, then mastering it means focusing just on starting the company and getting it profitable, but not getting involved with ongoing management, since management is a different skill.
	Once a company is profitable, the focused entrepreneur should then start a new company.
</p><p>
	The Art of Learning talks a lot about mastering the simple skills one at a time.
</p><p>
	In his chess examples, he would spend weeks competing with his teacher with only two pieces on the board, to thoroughly understand strategy with just those two pieces.
</p><p>
	In his Tai Chi examples, he would spend hours a day for days or weeks on end, just doing one simple arm extension.
</p><p><strong>
	But what are the building block ingredients to entrepreneurship?
</strong>
	Coming up with ideas?
	Turning rough ideas into a specific plan?
	Turning plans into a working system and specific goals?
	Working with people to ensure those goals are met?
</p><p>
	Sorry I’m all questions and no answers today, but I’m really curious to hear your thoughts.
