<!-- Is your album a starting line or a finish line? -->
<p>
	People often asked me, “How much does the average artist on CD Baby sell?”
</p><p>
	Some people would take our posted sales figures and divide them.
	$85 million paid, divided by 250,000 available albums = $340 per album.
</p><p>
	The numbers are right but the answer is wrong because it groups together two completely different types of approaches to an album release.
</p><p><strong>
	For some artists, releasing an album is like the starting line in a race.
</strong>
	The gun goes off!
	They work it!
	They spend hours a day pushing, promoting, selling, striving.
	For the next few months, they never stop.
	Reaching new people by any means necessary, whether playing live for strangers in strange venues many times a week, or joining new communities online.
</p><p>
	For those types, I’d say the average income, through my one little store, was $5000.
	Fifty of them earned over $100,000 each.
</p><p><strong>
	But for many artists, releasing an album is like the finish line in a race.
</strong>
	They’ve always wanted to make a record.
	They did it.
	It’s done.
	They give some for free to friends and family, and glow in the compliments.
	They might do a record release concert and make a website, but in terms of effort spent, they’re done.
	Sometimes from satisfaction, but sometimes from entitlement.
	Like, “Now that my brilliant album is done the world will recognize my genius!”
</p><p>
	For those types, I’d say the average income was $20.
</p><p>
	The people who would ask about the average were usually artists trying to predict how well they would sell on CD Baby.
</p><p>
	Because 50% of all sales on CD Baby were returning customers just browsing for new music, it was possible to sell a few albums without doing anything at all.
</p><p>
	It’s up to you which kind of approach you want to take.
