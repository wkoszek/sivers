<!-- The Grand Pursuit -->
<p>
	Great phrase from <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/05/12/pf/soros_interview.moneymag/">this interview with rags-to-riches investor George Soros</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
	Have your billions made you happy?
</blockquote><blockquote>
	I’m reasonably happy, but the money’s not the point. It’s an indication that I’ve succeeded in <strong>the grand adventure of understanding reality</strong>.
</blockquote>
<p>
	I love the way he puts that.
</p><p>
	For him it’s investing.
	For others it’s songwriting.
	For me it’s creating businesses that help musicians.
</p><p>
	It all feels like a grand pursuit to understand the world, doesn’t it?
</p>
<ul><li>
	Songwriting feels like a grand pursuit of expressing the sounds and thoughts in your head within music’s restrictions.
	Understanding the secret combination that makes the difference between an average song and an unforgettable classic.
</li><li>
	Programming feels like a grand pursuit of using a limited language to make the clearest, foolproof, flexible, and efficient execution of a task.
</li><li>
	Entrepreneurship (“businessing”?) feels like a grand pursuit of helping other people achieve their goals.
</li></ul>
<p>
	What’s your grand pursuit?
