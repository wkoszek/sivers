<!-- Real rebellion is going to school wearing a clown suit -->
<p>
	When the subject of rebellion comes up with friends, I often share <a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/mb/lonely_dissent/">this quote</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
	Real rebellion doesnâ€™t feel like going to school dressed in black.
	It feels like going to school wearing a clown suit.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
	For all you musicians and entrepreneurs who are used to having people tell you your plan, band, or company will never work, let this be a great reminder of what real rebellion feels like, and how sweet it is when everyone else is wrong.
