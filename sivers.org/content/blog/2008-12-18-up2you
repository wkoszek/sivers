<!-- Nobody’s going to help you. Does that encourage you or discourage you? -->
<p>
	Nobody’s going to help you.
	It’s all up to you.
</p><p><strong>
	Does hearing that discourage you or motivate you?
</strong></p><p>
	For example:
	Are you hoping that a great world-class booking agent will find you and sign you?
	I believe no great agents will want to take you on unless you’re already earning $5000 a month gigging, so that their 10% cut (only $500) would be worth their time.
</p><p>
	Or are you hoping to find a big investor for your music?
	Someone to invest $500k into your band for radio promotion, touring, recording, videos, publicity, payola, etc.
	I believe there are no investors that would invest in a musician now.
	Even solid profitable businesses with customers and employees can’t find investors, so just assume you will not.
</p><p>
	So: No agent. No investor.
	No one’s going to help you until you’re already successful.
	So how do you get successful with no help from anyone?
</p><p>
	How can you make $5000/month from gigging, so that an agent will be interested enough to take it to the next level?
	Only you know.
</p><p>
	How can you call so much attention to your music online, that a company will gamble on you, and finance the expensive offline campaign?
</p><p>
	Those are the healthy questions to ask.
</p><p>
	To some people, this approach is really discouraging.
</p><p>
	To me, this approach is really encouraging.
</p><p>
	I like being reminded that nobody’s going to help me - that it’s all up to me.
	It puts my focus back on the things I can control - not waiting for outside circumstances.
