<!-- Don’t... if you think it’s going to make you happy -->
<p>
	I was thinking of moving to India for six months.
</p><p>
	I called my friend Tina to discuss it.
	We talked about pros and cons.
</p><p>
	In the end, I asked, “Is there any reason not to go?”
</p><p>
	She thought deeply then said, “Yes. <strong>Don’t go if you think it’s going to make you happy.</strong>”
</p><p>
	Brilliant.
