	Do you have some quotes that inspire you, as you make your own music?
</p><p>
	I’ve always loved those little thoughts that would inspire me to dig deeper in my songwriting, try new sounds in the studio, or listen to music in a new way.
</p><p>
	A few years ago, I collected these quotes into a simple website:
</p><p>
<a href="http://musicthoughts.com">musicthoughts.com</a>
</p><p>
	It’s there for two reasons:
</p><ol><li>
	to inspire other musicians
</li><li>
	to collect other thoughts about music
</li></ol><p>
	I think you’ll love this new update:
	I hired professional translators to translate MusicThoughts into nine languages:
	Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Japanese, and Chinese.
</p><p>
	Look again, and play with the language bar across the bottom:
<a href="http://musicthoughts.com">http://musicthoughts.com</a>
</p><p>
	After browsing around the site for a while, if you’ve got a favorite quote that inspires your music-making, please add it to the site.
	I’m not trying to make this a big site of all thoughts about music - just a simple quiet place with a few of the most inspiring ones.
