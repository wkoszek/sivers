<!-- Accelerate change -->
<p>
	I want to accelerate change.
	All change, even “bad”.
</p><p>
	I put “bad” in quotes, because that’s what others call it, though I don’t believe you can <a href="/horses">call a fact bad or good</a>.
</p><p>
	Why do I want even “bad” change?
	Because it’s a challenge.
	And I’m one confident mofo.
	I can handle anything the world throws my way.
	So bring it on!
</p><p>
	Accelerating change is a time machine.
	Let’s get the future here faster.
	Change is good training.
</p><p>
	There’s opportunity in everything.
	If it’s something that most people see as a “bad” change, then discovering its benefit is even more fun.
</p><p>
	Cut off my legs, and I’ll still find a way to <a href="/aimee-mullins">run</a>.
