<!-- Have you looked under the chickens? -->
<p>
	One of the problems with being an expert at something, is <strong>you forget what it’s like to not know the basics</strong>.
</p><p>
	Because I like being very easy to contact, I get all kinds of questions about the music business and entrepreneurship.
</p><p>
	Some of them are so basic, I’m almost stumped!
</p><p>
	It’s like someone asks you, “I’ve got this henhouse full of chickens, but <strong>I don’t see any eggs</strong>. What should I do?”
</p><p><em>
	You think, “Hmmm... Maybe it’s a strange disease? Maybe the chickens are old? Maybe it’s temperature?”
</em></p><p>
	Before getting complicated, you dare to ask the obvious, “Uh... have you looked under the chickens?”
</p><p>
	You hear a pause, and then:
	“Hey! There they are! Wow! I never thought of that! Thanks so much!”
</p><p>
	Computer technicians, plumbers and doctors must have this more than anyone.
</p><p>
	I like getting these questions, though.
	They’re a good reminder of beginner’s mind.
	I try to remember all the questions I must have asked when I was just getting started.
