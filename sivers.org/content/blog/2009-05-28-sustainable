	A woman came up to me at a music conference, handed me her CD, and very proudly said, “This album cost $80,000 and two years to record. Everything is top-notch - we used one of the finest studios in the world.”
</p><p>
	She wanted me to be impressed, but once she said “$80,000” I lost hope in her ability to make a living making music.
</p><p>
	The music may be brilliant, but <strong>for a career to be sustainable, it has to be profitable.</strong>
</p><p>
	I’d be much more impressed with someone who could make an album for $8000, because that would show <strong>sustainability</strong>.
	They could record ten albums for the price of hers!
</p><p>
	I’d be most impressed with someone who could say, “This album cost nothing, and took two months to record, because I used my own home studio, and know how to make it sound great. My next 10 albums will also cost nothing.”

	A big hit at the Cannes Film Festival last week was the movie “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1278322/">Colin</a>”, <strong>made for only $70</strong>.
	The director used volunteer actors, used leftover makeup, and borrowed friends’ equipment.
</p><p>
	There’s a similar story behind the movie “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Mariachi">El Mariachi</a>”, made for only $7000 by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001675/">Robert Rodriguez</a>, who went on to do <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0227538/">Spy Kids</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a>, and more.
</p><p>
	Both are admittedly low-budget, but prove the resourcefulness of the director, and their ability to make a great film despite any restraints.
</p><p>
	If I was an investor, I’d invest in that kind of person.
</p><p><strong>
	Talent usually increases over time, but the ability to be resourceful usually decreases over time.
</strong></p><p>
	It’s best for a career to start from a place of absolute resourcefulness.
