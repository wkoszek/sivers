<!-- What do musicians and entrepreneurs have in common? -->
<p>
<strong>
	I decided at 14 I was going to be a full-time musician.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Because of this, I knew:
</p><ul><li>
	I’d never have a job.
</li><li>
	I’d never have a salary.
</li><li>
	I’d never have insurance.
</li><li>
	I’d never have a boss.
</li><li>
	I’d have no security - no guarantees.
</li><li>
	Nobody would help me.
	I’d have to bootstrap everything myself.
</li><li>
	Fighting against apathy and gatekeepers would be a constant struggle.
</li><li>
	I’d have to be one-in-a-million brilliant to achieve this incredibly difficult goal.
</li></ul>
<p>
	But I was psyched about this!
	This was my dream-come-true scenario.
	I told everyone I was going to be a successful musician.
</p><p>
	And I did.
	I worked nonstop.
	I started touring profitably when I was 18.
	I moved to New York City, and did whatever it takes to make a living as a musician.
	When I was 27, I bought a house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodstock,_New_York">Woodstock</a> with the money I made touring.
	I was living the dream.
</p><p>
	Someone asked me why I chose the entrepreneur path instead of the 9-5 job mindset.
</p><p>
<strong>
	But everything in that list applies to entrepreneurs, too.
</strong>
</p><p>
	If you decide to start your own company, you’re not going to have a job, boss, or guaranteed income.
	It’ll be a constant uphill struggle, without help from anyone.
</p><p>
	No wonder I fell into being an entrepreneur so naturally.
</p><p>
<strong>
	All those negatives are my dream-come-true scenario.
