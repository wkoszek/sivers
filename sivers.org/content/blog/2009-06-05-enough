<!-- You have enough. -->
<p>
	I love my computer and Kindle, but you won’t hear me rave about them.
	I don’t want you to want them.
</p><p>
	Companies spend a fortune begging you to want their stuff.
	I won’t add to that noise.
</p><p>
	I’d like to train parrots to say “<strong>It won’t make you happy!</strong>.”
	I'd let them loose in shopping malls, big electronics stores, and car lots.
	Then, when people are considering spending their savings on a giant TV, or going deeply in debt with a new car, a surprising squawk might shock them back to their senses.
</p><p>
	The quickest way to double your income is to halve your expenses.
	Any study of happiness will tell you it’s best to actively appreciate what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	I feel a responsibility to only put helpful thoughts into the world.
</p><p>
	So, no product raves here.
	You already have more than you need.
