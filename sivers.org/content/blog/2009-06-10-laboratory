<!-- Why you need your own company -->
<p>
	It was early 2008.
	I had agreed to <a href="/bye-bye-baby">sell my company</a> - my sole obsession of the last 10 years.
	The paperwork was processing.
</p><p>
	I hated having 85 employees.
	It had become a little hell.
	I needed to get away and clear my mind.
</p>

<p>
	I went as far away as I could - to a hot-springs Shinto shrine on a volcano at the southern tip of Japan.
</p><p>
	I sat silently.
	I steamed.
	I soaked.
	I slept to the sounds of the sea.
</p><p>
	I could not have been more relaxed.
	My head was empty.
</p><p>
	For the first time in ten years, I had nothing I needed to do.
	No responsibilities.
	No plans.
</p><p>
	What a relief, right?
	Can you imagine?
</p><p>
	I brought along the great book “<a href="http://www.poorcharliesalmanack.com/seeking_wisdom.php">Seeking Wisdom</a>”, and read in my peaceful Japanese ocean-facing room.
</p><p>
	The book was great.
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Munger">Charlie Munger</a>’s thoughts on behavioral finance were brilliant and contrarian.
<strong>
	This book was inspiring all kinds of entrepreneurial ideas that I wanted to try!
</strong>
</p><p>
	When I was at CD Baby, I’d be able to play with new ideas immediately.
	Any time I had an idea, I’d be able to test it out within days.
</p><p>
	But now, for the first time in 10 years, <strong>since I had no company, I couldn’t test out these new ideas!</strong>
	All I could do was read, think, and maybe write about it.
	Damn!
</p><p>
	Then I realized why I need to start a new company.
	Not for the money.
	Not because I’m “bored”.
	But because <strong>a company is a laboratory to try your ideas</strong>.
	The word “laboratory” is defined as a room for research, experimentation or analysis.
	I think of it as a sandbox or playpen.
</p><p>
	Realizing this in my peaceful hot-springs, I caught a train back to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuoka">Fukuoka</a>, and jumped into action.
</p><p>
	I started <a href="http://muckwork.com/">MuckWork</a> so I could play with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">crowdsourcing</a> while helping people get their boring work done.
</p><p>
	I re-launched <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/">MusicThoughts</a> to experiment with a fully multi-lingual site.
</p><p>
	And this made me happier than doing nothing.
	This isn’t work, it’s play.
	It’s my place to try my ideas.
</p><p>
	We all need some time off.
	A change of scene and pace.
	Silence and solace if we’re stressed.
	Reckless adrenaline if we’re in a rut.
</p><p>
	But for those of us who think that an eternal escape from work would be paradise, don’t forget that <strong>we all need a playground</strong>, and your own company is one of the best playgrounds of all.

	There's a great quote from Australian psychiatrist W. Béran Wolfe:
<em>
	“If you observe a really happy man you will find him building a boat, writing a symphony, educating his son, or looking for dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert.” 
</em>
</p><p>
	And another from psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky:
<em>
	“Find a happy person, and you will find a project.”
