<!-- Early drafts of great work are encouraging -->
<p>
<strong>
	I get so encouraged looking at early drafts of great work, thinking, “I can do that!”
</strong>
</p><p>
	In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSoJUMnLc1o">this clip from “Le mystère Picasso”</a>, you watch Picasso start with a simple scribble of a goat, then flesh it out.
	Not only adding textures, but changing his mind and removing things as well.
</p><p>
	After making the brilliant movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401792/">Sin City</a>, director Robert Rodriguez was cool enough to include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lTL16a0KxFQ">the entire film as it was really shot on a green screen</a>.
</p><p>
	The Beatles’ “Anthology” had some great outtakes and early versions of songs I thought of as untouchably perfect.
	Like seeing <a href="http://www.anvari.org/cols/Stars_without_Make_Up.html">stars without makeup</a>, you realize how much of the magic is in the finishing touches.
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.archive.org/">Archive.org</a>’s wonderful <a href="http://www.archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a> lets us see:</p>
<ul>
</li><li>
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19961017235908/http://www2.yahoo.com/">yahoo.com from 1996</a>
</li><li>
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981205052232/http://www.cdbaby.com/">cdbaby.com from 1998</a>
</li><li>
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981111184551/http://google.com/">google.com from 1998</a>
</li><li>
	<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031004101518/http://myspace.com/">myspace.com from 2003</a>
</li><li>
	and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050806011211/http://facebook.com/">facebook.com from 2005</a> when it was still called “The Facebook”.
</li></ul>
<p>
	I meet so many potential entrepreneurs who think they have to spend millions and months in development before launching.
	(And therefore, they often never launch.)
</p><p>
	For the first nine months of CD Baby, every page was hand-coded HTML and the site did nothing but email the order details to me.
	I had to copy-and-paste all the info from each email into four places: a mailing label, a thank-you email, a vendor-alert email, and a Filemaker database.
	It was as lo-fi as can be, but it was enough to get started, and it was profitable.
</p><p>
	So I’m writing this in hopes that we get more of these “<a href="/infinity">Version 0.1</a>” stories out there.
	Encouraging potential entrepreneurs, songwriters, artists, and inventors to compare themselves to the early drafts, not the final polished perfection.
