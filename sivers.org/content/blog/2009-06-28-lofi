<!-- Version 0.1 = Start lo-fi -->
<p>
	First read “<a href="/infinity">Version ∞</a>” and “<a href="/early">Early drafts...</a>”.
	Here’s <strong>an example of how I think of “Version 0.1”</strong>:
</p><p>
	A guy at a conference was telling me how <strong>he really wanted to build a music recommendation service, but had been trying for a year to raise the $2 million dollars he said it’d take</strong> to build it.
</p><p>
	My suggestion for him:
<strong>
	Don’t wait for funding.
	Start now.
</strong>
</p><p>
	To start a music recommendation service, just start recommending music to friends, find out if they liked it, and improve from there.
	No fancy app or website needed.
</p><p>
	By getting that initial lo-fi hands-on experience, you’ll have a deeper understanding of what people really want from music recommendations.
</p><p>
	Then you can build your service incrementally based on real user communication, instead of hiding in a lab for a year programming in isolation based on a year-old hunch.
</p><p>
	If you say you want to do something, do it!
	Never blame outside forces stopping you.
	Work around obstacles to start immediately.
