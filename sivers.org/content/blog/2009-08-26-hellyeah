<!-- No “yes.” Either “HELL YEAH!” or “no.” -->
<p>
	Use this rule if you’re often over-committed or too scattered.
</p><p>
	If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about something, say “no”.
</p><p>
	When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than “Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!” — then say “no.” 
</p><p>
	When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to really throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say “HELL YEAH!”
</p><p>
	Every event you get invited to.
	Every request to start a new project.
	If you’re not saying “HELL YEAH!” about it, say “no.”
</p><p>
	We’re all busy.
	We’ve all taken on too much.
	Saying yes to less is the way out.
