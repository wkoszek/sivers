<!-- What do you hate not doing? -->
<p>
	We’ve all asked ourselves, “What do I really love?” or “What makes me happy?”
</p><p>
	I struggle when the emotion-based answers conflict with expectations.
	For example:
	I’m a musician, but I love working alone.
	Does that mean I should be a producer instead of performer?
	I’m an entrepreneur but I hate doing business deals.
	Does that mean I’m more of a CTO than CEO?
</p><p>
	Last week I thought of it a different way, that I like better:
</p><p>
<strong>
	What do you hate <em>not</em> doing?
</strong>
</p><p>
	What makes you feel icky, irritated, annoyed or off-track if you <em>don’t</em> do it enough?
</p>

	I hate not programming.
</dt>
<dd>
	Programming, to me, is the ultimate purposeful creativity.
	I have so many ideas in my head of websites that would make the world a better place if they existed, services that could help people.
	It’s just a matter of taking a thousand hours to type it all out and turn ideas into reality.
	Any week not programming is a disappoinment to myself and maybe to others.
</dd>
<dt>
	I hate not writing.
</dt>
<dd>
	There are so many things I’ve learned that I think would help other people to know.
	Things I wish someone had told me sooner.
	Things that have made my life better, brighter, or wiser.
	I want to tell everyone these things before I die, in a well-explained way so they’re not misunderstood, and easy to pass on to others.
	And more new ones are added every week.
	So I have to keep writing to get them all out.
	Any day I’m not writing, I’m falling further behind in this goal, which I makes me feel worse.

	I hate not biking.
</dt>
<dd>
	I love the adrenaline rush of riding my bike.
	I love knowing it’s good for my health, and making my legs and cardiovascular system stronger so I can bike even further some day.
	I love it so much that when I don’t do it for even a few days, I get annoyed.
	When I see other people biking, and I’m not biking, I get jealous.
</dd>
<dt>
	I hate not talking with friends.
</dt>
<dd>
	I’m in my own head so much, that I love hearing what my friends are thinking about instead.
	I love how my friends think.
	I care about them and feel icky when too disconnected from them for too long.
</dd>
</dl>
<p>
	Asking the double-negative seems to be a better indicator of what I really love doing, than asking it in the positive.

	So, what do you hate NOT doing?
