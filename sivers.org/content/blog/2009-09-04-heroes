<!-- My heroes -->
<p>
	Like a musician names their musical influences, let me tell you about my heroes.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/bio.asp">Seth Godin</a></dt>
<dd>
	Seth is my favorite thinker.
	A huge inspiration and mentor.
	I often ask myself, “What would Seth say?”
	I usually don’t even need to ask him, because I’ve ingested <a href="http://sethgodin.com/sg/books.asp">his books</a> so thoroughly.
	But I’ve called him in rare times of huge indecision since 2003, and his advice has directly influenced my biggest decisions.
(<em>
	I’m being as succinct as possible, but even got a little teary-eyed thinking back about this.
</em>)

<dt><a href="http://zenhabits.net/about/">Leo Babauta</a></dt>
<dd>
	First <a href="http://zenhabits.net/my-story/">read his story</a>, then <a href="/book/PowerOfLess">read his book</a>.
	Focus is required to have that level of effectiveness in whatever you do.
	In our crazy, distracted multitasking world, Leo’s approach to life is a role model to me.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://timferriss.com/">Tim Ferriss</a></dt>
<dd>
	<a href="/2008-08-tim-ferriss">Read my intro to our interview</a> for details, but this audacious punk and I are a lot alike.
	I admire his constant results-focused search for shortcuts and harmless cheating.
	(Why not gain an “unfair” advantage in education and self-development?)
	I admire how he throws himself completely into something, while treating it all as an experiment.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://twitter.com/cyberpr">Ariel Hyatt</a></dt>
<dd>
	One of my best friends because I so admire the way she thinks.
	Most recently she dove completely into her own re-education about modern marketing, learning from the masters in non-music realms, and is applying what she’s learned back to the music world in an incredible way.
	Also, because she was raised by high-society New Yorkers and I was raised by a pack of wild kittens, she is my consultant on manners and norms.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson">Richard Branson</a></dt>
<dd>
	I’ve read all of his <a href="/book/BusinessStrippedBare">biographies</a> and <a href="/book/RichardBranson">autobiographies</a> and so admire his approach of, “That sounds interesting. Let’s make it a business.”
	I love his non-MBA intuitive approach to business, and never forgetting the real point is to make people happy.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/blog/team-members/hugh-macleod/">Hugh MacLeod</a></dt>
<dd>
	His book, “<a href="/book/IgnoreEverybody">Ignore Everybody</a>” is the absolute best I’ve read on thriving in the balance of creativity and business.
	I love his perspective and refer to it often.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://paulgraham.com/">Paul Graham</a></dt>
<dd>
	His <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html">essays</a> were a massive influence on me, so I loved it when he compiled them into <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hackpaint.html">a book</a>.
	A fellow programmer and entrepreneur, his clear thinking always resonates with me.
	I aspire to write, think, and code as well as he does.
</dd>

<dt><a href="http://seriouspony.com/about/">Kathy Sierra</a></dt>
<dd>
	See her <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> blog and click the “Past Favorites” on the left-hand side.
	Her lessons in communication and teaching are in my head every time I write.
</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Harry-Beckwith/e/B000AP8Q0Q">Harry Beckwith</a></dt>
<dd>
	Harry’s book “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0446672319/">Selling the Invisible</a>” is what got me to start writing.
	I love his mindset of considerate humanist marketing, so beautifully communicated.
	See my notes from his new book “<a href="/book/YouInc">You, Inc</a>” for a sample.
	If Harry blogged, he’d be an online superstar.
