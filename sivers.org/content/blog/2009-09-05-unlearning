<!-- Unlearning -->
<p>
	When I would speak on panels at music conferences, I’d always find it funny how all of the panelists’ opinions were completely tainted by their own self-interest.
</p><p>
	Someone would always ask us, “What’s the future of the music business?”
</p><p>
	The guy whose company sells MP3s would say, “MP3s are the future. The public has spoken and they want MP3s.”
</p><p>
	The guy whose company sells subscriptions would say, “Subscription services are the future. No need to keep a huge music collection.”
</p><p>
	The guy whose company sells CDs would say, “People still want something tangible they can hold in their hand. CDs are going to be around a long time.”
</p><p>
	I would just say, “<a href="/no-oracle">Nobody knows the future. Anyone who pretends to is full of shit and not to be trusted</a>.”
	That would get me a weird look from my fellow panelists, but oh well.
</p><p>
	I still get asked to talk about the future of the music industry, but I just can’t.
	My answer to everything is, “<strong>I don’t know.</strong>”
</p><p>
	For the last 11 years, I spent most waking hours thinking about how to sell and distribute music.
	I’m completely unobjective!
	I don’t have fresh eyes about it anymore.
	I know my opinion is not to be trusted.
</p><p>
	You’d be better off to ask a young music fan or musician, unencumbered by too much knowledge of the past.
</p><p>
	I love <strong>musicians</strong>.
	I love the <strong>creative process</strong>.
	I love the art and craft of <strong>learning, writing and playing music</strong>.
</p><p>
	But the “industry” around it?
	Eh.
	No interest.
	Sorry.
	I’m burnt-out on that subject.
	I need to spend some years <strong>unlearning</strong> before I can think about it again.
</p><p>
	Two great quotes about this:
</p><ol><li>
	Alvin Toffler said:
	“The illiterates of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”
</li><li>
	John Cage said:
	“I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.”
