<!-- Climbing ladders -->
<p>
	Do you know the story of how John Lennon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoko_Ono#John_Lennon">met</a> Yoko Ono?
</p><p>
	He went to a friend’s art gallery and saw an empty room with a tall ladder going up to the ceiling.
</p><p>
	He climbed to the top of the ladder, and there was just a magnifying glass which, if held up to the ceiling, revealed a little tiny word “yes”.
</p><p>
	He loved it, and asked about the artist.  It was Yoko, and that’s how they met.

	In the early 1990s I met this girl, and hit it off right away.
</p><p>
	When I mentioned that I would love to find someone like Yoko, and really admired her work, her eyes went big and she said, “Wow! Really? I love Yoko! I’ve never met anyone else who does!”
</p><p>
	It was an endearing moment between us.
</p><p>
	We dated for a while, but lost touch.

	This year on Facebook, she added me as a friend.
</p><p>
	I emailed, saying, “Wow! Long time! How are you?”
	She’s happily married and doing well.
</p><p>
	She asks how I’m doing.
	I filled her in, then added at the end, “P.S. Still looking for my Yoko.”
</p><p>
	Her reply was priceless:
</p><p>
	“If history serves, you don’t look for a Yoko. A Yoko simply appears when you least expect her. Just keep climbing ladders.”
