<!-- Is there such a thing as too much freedom? -->
<p>
	I’ve always used freedom as the compass to guide my decisions.
</p><p>
	We moved a lot when I was a kid.
	Lived in five states and countries by the time I was 5.
</p><p>
	I left home at 17 and went off to college as far away as I could.
</p><p>
	I joined a circus for 10 years.
	Then I quit my last job in 1992, vowing to make a living making music and never have a job again.
</p><p>
	In 2002, only 4 years into my company’s 10-year history, I delegated all of my responsibilities, making myself unnecessary to the operations of my company, so that I was free to go live anywhere and do anything.
	Though I still chose to work on my company, I would work on future stuff not day-to-day stuff.
</p><p>
	My email was filtered by the customer service staff.
	Hardly any needed my personal reply, so I was free to go days without checking email.
</p><p>
	I gave nobody my phone number, and said no to all meeting requests, so I was free to work on my own schedule with no appointments to interrupt.
</p><p>
	I gave away most of my possessions, including my entire recording studio, to my employees.
	So all I had left were some clothes, books, and my laptop.
	Free to travel lightly.
</p><p>
	I eliminated all physical mail, setting my necessary bills to electronic payments, and had tax forms go to my accountant.
	I was free to move without notice.
</p><p>
	I moved to London for a year, just because I could.
	I hardly told anyone I was gone.
	Most people thought I was still in Portland.
</p><p>
	Then I went to San Francisco for a few months, India for a month, and Iceland for a month.
</p><p>
	Friends back home would say, “So what did you do in Iceland?”
</p><p>
	I’d say, “Same thing as you. Same thing I’d be doing anywhere else. Just programming, working, writing, reading, flirting, living.”
</p><p>
	Living the laptop life.
	Location agnostic.
	Switching countries was like switching rooms in your house.
	Why not go sit in the den for a while?
	Why not do some writing in the kitchen for a change
	How about the back yard?
</p><p>
	How about Berlin for a while?
	Brazil?
	Buenos Aires?
	Beijing?
	It’s a big world.
	Why not do my work in each of these places?
</p><p>
	I could be anywhere, but didn’t have to be anywhere.
</p><p>
	But even though I had freedom of location, I still had some responsibilities to my company.
	CEO/owner type stuff.
	And I was still the main programmer, so in all of these places, I’d still be working mostly on the backend programming, improving the site and service.
</p><p>
	My company grew 1000% while I was gone, from 2002 to 2008.
	But once I left for good in 2008, I really had no more responsibilities at all, and might never again.
</p><p>
	I could do anything, but didn’t have to do anything.
</p><p>
	This is where it started to get a little overwhelming.
</p><p>
	I had done it!
	I’d reached the final destination of my life-long pursuit of freedom!
</p><p>
	And yes, it’s awesome.
	So....  Wow.  Now what?
</p><p>
	Where do you go, when you can be anywhere, and don’t have to be anywhere?
</p><p>
	What do you do, when you can do anything, and don’t have to do anything?
</p><p>
	What if you had no ties?
	Nothing holding you to any one place.
	What if you had unlimited plane tickets?
	What if you never had to work again?
</p><p>
	Is there such a thing as too much freedom?
</p><hr /><p>
	This story isn’t coming to some conclusion where I answer the question.
	I’m still living the question.
</p><p>
	I’m starting some new projects, but they’ll have no employees, no office, and are designed to run without me from the start.
</p><p>
	I’m in New York City right now, until it feels like home, then I’ll move somewhere else.
</p><p>
	Some predict I’ll stop moving when I fall in love with the right person, but I think the right person would also want to live around the world too.
</p><p>
	I’m definitely happy and complete, so there’s no sense of longing or lacking.
	Just a constant pursuit of learning and experiencing all I can before I die.
</p><p>
	But those same two questions keep coming up:
</p><p>
	Where do you go, when you can be anywhere, and don’t have to be anywhere?
</p><p>
	What do you do, when you can do anything, and don’t have to do anything?
