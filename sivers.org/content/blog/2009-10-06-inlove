	What’s the difference between like, love, and in-love?
</p><p>
	How do you know when you love someone instead of just liking them a lot?
</p><p>
	How do you know when you’re “in-love” with someone instead of just loving them as a person?
</p><p>
	I asked a bunch of friends these questions, and got a huge variety of answers:
</p>
<blockquote>
	“If I like anything about someone, I like them.
	If I like everything about someone, I love them.
	If I like everything about someone and we have great sex, I’m in love.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	“Like is liking someone, but conditionally.
	Love is liking someone unconditionally.
	In-love is just glorification of a temporary infatuation.
	Eventually it becomes love.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
	“This sounds morbid, but I think of it in terms of how I’d react if they died.
	If I like someone and they died, I’d be sad and cry once or twice.
	If I love someone and they died, I’d be devastated and cry for days or weeks.
	If I’m in love with someone and they died, I’d want to die too.”
</blockquote>
<p>
	How do you know?
</p><p>
	Do other languages have different terms for “love” versus “in love” that make it more poetically distinct?
