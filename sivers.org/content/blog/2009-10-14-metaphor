<!-- Learning the metaphor, not the example. -->
<p>
	Learning how to read <strong>metaphorically</strong> was a major turning point in my life.
</p><p>
	When I was 19, attending Berklee College of Music, I had no interest in anything but music itself.
	But a teacher made us read the book “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positioning_(marketing)">Positioning</a>”, which is a straight-up business book.
	I thought, “Business? Yuk! I’m at music school, not business school! I just want to be a musician, not some corporate suit!”
</p><p>
	But then he showed us how we could apply that book’s business lessons to our music.
	Even though the book makes no mention of music, he told us to <strong>translate</strong> the examples to whatever we’re doing.
</p><p>
	In other words:
	Don’t focus on the example itself.
	Use it as a <strong>metaphor</strong>, and apply the <strong>theme</strong> or the <strong>lesson</strong> of the story to my situation.
	It sounds obvious to say it now, but I’d never looked at it that way before.
</p><p>
	I realized I could advance my music career by reading <a href="/book">books that make no mention of music</a>.
	In fact I’d have a competitive advantage by doing so, since most musicians won’t!
</p><p>
	Now here I am, 20 years later.
	I try to share the lessons I’ve learned — lessons that apply to entrepreneurs, musicians, and people of all different pursuits.
	But in the comments, I notice people are often focused on the specific example I used.
</p><p>
	It’s never about the example.
	It’s about the theme that can be applied to whatever you want.
	I should try to make it clear that this example is just one example, and that this lesson can be applied to anything.
</p><p>
	But that’s one thing I love about comments.
	They let me know when I’ve been <a href="/unclear">unclear</a>.
