<!-- "Online" marketing = "Color" TV -->
<p>
	I can’t help but smile when I pass an old motel that still has the sign advertising “Color TV!”
</p><p>
	In 1960, it was important to mention that you weren’t talking about ordinary black and white TV.
	No, this is the new special <em>color</em> TV!
	Oooh!
</p><p>
	But now that all TVs are color, it’s funny to hear it referred to as “color” TV.
	It really dates them.
</p><p>
	Now I can’t help but smile when I hear people talk about “online marketing.”
</p><p>
	In 1995, it was important to mention that you weren’t talking about ordinary print-paper marketing.
	No, this is the new special <em>online</em> marketing!
	Oooh!
</p><p>
	But now that all marketing is online, it’s funny to hear someone (especially a business person) refer to it as “online” marketing.
	It really dates them.
