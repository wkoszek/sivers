<!-- Put buskers online -->
<p>
	Here’s a business idea, inspired by an email from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ujjayisoundsystem">Stephen Brown</a> today.
</p><p>
	You know the “busker”, a person who entertains people in public places, while asking for money?
	What if we put that busking process online?
</p><p>
<strong>
	A website where videos of street musicians are collected all in one place, each with a PayPal link so anyone watching can give some money directly to that musician.
</strong>
</p><p>
	See a great musician playing on the street in Cuba, Argentina, Egypt, India, or anywhere else?
	Make the best recording you can with a video camera.
	When they take a break, find out if they have a website and a PayPal address.
	If so, write it down.
	If not, set them up with one.
	(If they don’t have email, set them up an email account first, then a PayPal account pointing to that email account, etc.  Write down the info for them.  Even if they can’t access it yet, they will some day.)
</p><p>
	Then, with their permission, upload the video to YouTube with their name, exact location, and email in the metadata.
</p><p>
	Then go to this website and make a page for them.  It only needs to ask a few things:
</p><ul>
<li>
	Performer’s name
</li><li>
	Email address (linked to PayPal)
</li><li>
	Exact location and date of performance
</li><li>
	URLs where videos and photos can be found
</li><li>
	Optional: text box for any other info you want to add
</li></ul><p>
	The site will automatically display the videos, and make a PayPal donate button that goes to the musician’s account.
</p><p>
	Anything to add or change to this idea?
