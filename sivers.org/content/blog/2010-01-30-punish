<!-- Don’t punish everyone for one person’s mistake -->
<p>
	The little diner near me has these big warning signs posted everywhere:
</p><ul><li>
	WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE FOR ANY REASON
</li><li>
	ALL ORDERS ARE FINAL! ABSOLUTELY NO REFUNDS!
</li><li>
	NO SHOES, NO SHIRT, NO SERVICE
</li><li>
	NO CELLPHONES. NO PHOTOS. NO VIDEOS.
</li><li>
	NO LOITERING! RESTROOM FOR CUSTOMERS ONLY!
</li><li>
	ALL VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW
</li></ul><p>
	Poor business owner needs a hug.
<strong>
	Every time someone upsets him, he punishes all his future customers forever.

	When I was six, I attended a strict little school in Abingdon, England.
	Early in the year, someone spilled grape juice, so they banished grape juice for the rest of the year.
	Later, someone spilled orange juice, so orange juice was banished for the rest of the year.
	Eventually we were allowed nothing but water.

	Many years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Reid_%28shoe_bomber%29">one guy</a> tried to light his shoes on fire on a plane.
	Now for all future time, millions of people a day have to queue up to take their shoes off at the airport, because of that one dumb moment.

	As a business owner, <strong>when you get screwed-over by someone, it’s tempting to make a big grand policy</strong> you think will prevent you from ever getting screwed-over again.
</p><p>
	One employee can’t focus, and spends his time surfing the web.
	Instead of just firing or reassigning that person to more challenging work, the company installs an expensive content-approving firewall so that nobody can go to unapproved sites ever again.
</p><p>
	It’s important to <strong>resist that simplistic, angry, reactionary urge to punish everyone</strong>, and step back to look at the big picture.
</p><p>
	In the moment, you’re angry, and focusing only on that one awful person who did you wrong.
	Your thinking is clouded.
	You start thinking everyone is awful, and the world is against you.
<strong>
	This is the worst time to make a new policy.
</strong>
</p><p>
	When one customer wrongs you, remember the thousands that did not.
</p><p>
	You’re lucky to own your own business.
	Life is good.
</p><p>
	You can’t prevent bad things from happening.
	Learn to shrug.
</p><p>
	Resist the urge to punish everyone for one person’s mistake.
