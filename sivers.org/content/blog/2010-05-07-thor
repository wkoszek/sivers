<!-- Thursday = Thor’s day -->
<p>
	Last week we had dinner at a quiet restaurant on the Oregon coast, and sat near two people that were obviously on a first date.
	(“So, do you have any siblings?”)
</p><p>
	When their conversation took an interesting turn, we couldn’t help but listen:
</p><p>
	“You’re an atheist? How can you not believe in God?”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“How can you not believe in Zeus or Thor?”
</p><p>
	“That’s stupid. Those are old folk-tales.”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“They were God! You’re dismissing others’ beliefs, calling them folk-tales? So you’re also an atheist for most gods that have ever existed. I just go one further.”
</p><p>
	“I’m not an atheist!”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“You and I are almost identical in our beliefs! If history has named, say, 520 gods, you don’t believe in 519 of them, I don’t believe in 520 of them.”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	...(long pause)...
</p><p>
	“What do you do on Christmas or Easter, then? Do you feel weird as a non-believer?”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“What do you do on Thursday?”
</p><p>
	“Huh?”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“Thursday was named after Thor. It’s Thor’s day. Do you feel weird as a non-believer?”
</p><p>
	“That’s not fair.”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“All the English days of the week are named after gods, sun, and moon. Look it up on Wikipedia. It’s wild.”
</p><p>
	“Why are you so into this?”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“I’m not. Spent maybe 20 minutes on it, tops. I’m not on a mission to dis-prove God any more than you’re on a mission to dis-prove Zeus. It’s really no big deal to me.”
</p><p>
	“So, I guess we’re not compatible, huh?”
</p><p> &nbsp;
	“Of course we are! I like you a lot. And we do agree on 519 of the gods, so we’ll just not mention that last one.”
</p><p>
	“OK. Deal. I like you a lot, too.”
</p><p>&nbsp;
	...(long pause)...
</p><p>&nbsp;
	“So what’s your favorite band?”
</p><p>
	“Oh, God.”
</p>

<p>
	I liked the reframing of the situation from “we’re opposite” to “we agree on 519 of the 520 gods.”
	I always love an <a href="/opposite">opposite point of view</a>.
