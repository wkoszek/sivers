<!-- KarmaList wishlist? -->
<p>
	I meet so many people by email.
	Almost everyone has something to offer.
	Almost everyone is looking for something.
</p><p>
	Sometimes they tell me about specific opportunities like:
</p><ul>
<li>
	“I’m running a venue here in Boston that’s always looking for good folk artists.”
</li><li>
	“We have good-paying gigs 4 nights a week, but our singer is moving. Know someone good?”
</li><li>
	“I have a radio show in Sydney, so if you want to send me some music...”
</li></ul><p>
	Unfortunately, all of this is just in my email inbox.
	I haven't organized these opportunities.
	And I can’t keep it all in my head.
</p><p>
	I’ve been planning on making <a href="http://karmalist.com/">KarmaList</a> an open database of contacts.
</p><p>
	But now I’m thinking I should also make it <strong>an organized list of who’s looking for what</strong>.
</p><p>
	I’d hire someone to go back through my email archive, and update the database with who’s looking and who’s offering.
	Visit URLs and <strong>validate everything</strong>, then post it on KarmaList, if they say OK.
</p><p>
<em>
	Maybe I’ll make it invitation-only, so the website will just be verified high-quality listings.
</em>
</p><p>
<strong>
	I do all this for fun, not money, so it will always be completely free.
</strong>
	(No ads, either.)
</p><p>
	But because I’m making this more for you than me, I might as well ask first:
</p><p>
<strong>
	Any wish-list for this kind of service?
</strong>
