<!-- Obvious to you. Amazing to others. -->
<p>
	Any creator of anything knows this feeling:
</p><p>
	You experience someone else’s innovative work.
	It’s beautiful, brilliant, breath-taking.
	You’re stunned.
</p><p>
	Their ideas are unexpected and surprising, but perfect.
</p><p><strong>
	You think, “I never would have thought of that. How do they even come up with that? It’s genius!”
</strong></p><p>
	Afterwards, you think, “My ideas are so obvious. I’ll never be as inventive as that.”
</p><p>
	I get this feeling often.
	Amazing books, music, movies, or even amazing conversations.
	I’m in awe at how the creator thinks like that.
	I’m humbled.
</p><p>
	But I continue to do my work.
	I tell my little tales.
	I share my point of view.
	Nothing spectacular.
	Just my ordinary thoughts.
</p><p>
	One day someone emailed me and said, “I never would have thought of that. How did you even come up with that? It’s genius!”
</p><p>
	Of course I disagreed, and explained why it was nothing special.
</p><p>
	But afterwards, I realized something surprisingly profound:
</p><p><strong>
	Everybody’s ideas seem obvious to them.
</strong></p><p>
	I’ll bet even John Coltrane or Richard Feynman felt that everything they were playing or saying was pretty obvious.
</p><p><strong>
	So maybe what’s obvious to me is amazing to someone else?
</strong></p><p>
	Hit songwriters often admit that their most successful hit song was one they thought was just stupid, even not worth recording.
</p><p>
	We’re clearly a bad judge of our own creations.
	We should just put it out and let the world decide.
</p><p><strong>
	Are you holding back something that seems too obvious to share?
