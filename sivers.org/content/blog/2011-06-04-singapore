<!-- I moved to Singapore -->
<p>
	I was born in California, and lived many years each in San Francisco, Santa Monica, Chicago, Boston, New York, Portland, and Seattle. I’m very American. I get America.
</p>
<p>
	So, in the name of <a href="/scares-excites-do-it">learning</a> and <a href="/maslow">growing</a>, it was time for me to move on and not live in America anymore.
</p>
<p>
	When I met my future girlfriend, I told her my plan and asked, “How would you feel about living in the rest of the world for the rest of your life?”
</p>
<p>
	She can do her work from anywhere, so she thought a bit and said, “Hmmmm... Yeah.  I could do that.”
</p>
<p>
	A year later, we took one carry-on bag each, and went around the world, looking for a new country to call <a href="/homeless">home</a>.
</p>
<p>
	We went down to Brazil, up to Sweden, around Europe, over to India and China.
	There’s so much going on in Asia, so exciting, so much to learn.
	I really wanted a home base in the middle of it all.
	And so we found <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Singapore">Singapore</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Singapore is 3 hours from India, China, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Bangladesh, and Taiwan.
	2 hours from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Philippines.
	Such a wonderful hub for this entire part of the world.
	<a href="https://www.tigerair.com/sg/en/real_deals.php">Cheap flights</a> to 13 countries for under $200.
</p>
<p>
	On our first visit, we met so many amazing people from <a href="http://www.nus.edu.sg/aboutus/">NUS</a>, <a href="http://hackerspace.sg/">Hackerspace</a>, <a href="http://e27.co/">e27</a>, <a href="http://www.edb.gov.sg/">EDB</a>, and <a href="https://www.insead.edu/">INSEAD</a>.
</p>
<p>
	Though there are 5 million people here, the music and entrepreneur scenes are quite small, so it feels like a small town in a big city, with the advantages of both.
	It’s a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ease_of_Doing_Business_Index">great place to set up a business</a>, which is important to me.
</p>
<p>
	I could go on and on about how much I love Singapore, but if you want a quick overview, the Discovery Channel did <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O12Lwol3iaY">a great documentary about it</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singapore">Wikipedia page</a> is good.
</p>
<p>
	We made some really dear friends on our first visit, and decided it was home.
	After eight months of waiting for the paperwork to process, <strong>we became official residents of Singapore yesterday</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	We rented an apartment.
	We got a kitten.
	I set up my new companies here.
	I’m an “entrepreneur in residence” at <a href="http://www.insead.edu/home/">INSEAD</a>, mentoring for <a href="http://www.edb.gov.sg/">EDB</a>, <a href="http://www.spring.gov.sg/">SPRING</a>, and <a href="http://ace.sg/">ACE</a>.
	And I’m back to work.
