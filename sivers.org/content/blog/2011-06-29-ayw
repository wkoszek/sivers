<!-- Anything You Want (my first book) -->
<p>
	For years, when people asked if I’d write a book, I said no.
</p>
<p>
	But when my hero <a href="http://www.sethgodin.com/sg/">Seth Godin</a> asked if I’d write a book for his new publishing company, I said <a href="/hellyeah">HELL YEAH!!</a>
</p>
<p>
	So, my first book is released today.
</p>
<p>
	It’s called “<a href="/a"><strong>Anything You Want</strong> - 40 Lessons for a New Kind of Entrepreneur</a>”.
</p>
<p>
	It’s <strong>40 short stories, sharing what I learned during starting, building, and selling CD Baby.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Not an autobiography, it’s really <strong>my top-40 tips for anyone starting or running a company.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Most of the lessons are counter-intuitive, learned from experience, and go against the usual business-book advice.
	If you know my blog, you’ll recognize some of the stories, but now in context.
</p>
<p>
	The website for the book is <a href="/a">sivers.org/a</a> - with links to all the different formats on Amazon.
</p>
<p>
	If you like to listen, I highly recommend the audio version.
	I recorded it myself, so it has more personality than the written word.
