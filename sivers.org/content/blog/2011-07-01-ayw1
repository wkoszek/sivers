<!-- Ten years of experience in one hour -->
<p>
	From 1998 to 2008, I had this wild experience of starting a little hobby, accidentally growing it into a big business, and then selling it for $22 million.
	So now people want to hear my thoughts.
</p><p>
	People ask me about that experience, so I tell stories about how it went for me.
	Many of them are about all the things I did wrong.
	I made some horrible mistakes.
</p><p>
	People ask my advice on how to approach situations in their lives or businesses, so I explain how I approach things.
	But my approach is just one way, and I could argue against it as well.
</p><p>
	I’m not really suggesting that anyone should be like me.
	I’m pretty unusual, so what works for me might not work for others.
	But enough people thought that my stories and the philosophies I developed from this experience were worth sharing, so here we are.
</p><p>
	This is most of what I learned in ten years, compacted into something you can read in an hour.
</p><p>
	I hope you find these ideas useful for your own life or business.
	I also hope you disagree with some of them.
	Then I hope you email me to tell me about your different point of view, because that’s my favorite part of all.
