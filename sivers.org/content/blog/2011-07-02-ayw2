<!-- What’s your compass? -->
<p>
	Most people don’t know why they’re doing what they’re doing.
	They imitate others, go with the flow, and follow paths without making their own.
</p><p>
	They spend decades in pursuit of something that someone convinced them they should want, without realizing that it won’t make them happy.
</p><p>
	Don’t be on your deathbed someday, having squandered your one chance at life, full of regret because you pursued little distractions instead of big dreams.
</p><p>
	You need to know your personal philosophy of what makes you happy and what’s worth doing.
</p><p>
	In the <a href="/a">following stories</a>, you’ll notice some common themes.
	These are my philosophies from the ten years I spent starting and growing a small business.
</p><ul>
<li>
	Business is not about money.
	It’s about making dreams come true for others and for yourself.
</li><li>
	Making a company is a great way to improve the world while improving yourself.
</li><li>
	When you make a company, you make a utopia.
	It’s where you design your perfect world.
</li><li>
	Never do anything just for the money.
</li><li>
	Don’t pursue business just for your own gain.
	Only answer the calls for help.
</li><li>
	Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what’s not working.
</li><li>
	Your business plan is moot.
	You don’t know what people really want until you start doing it.
</li><li>
	Starting with no money is an advantage.
	You don’t need money to start helping people.
</li><li>
	You can’t please everyone, so proudly exclude people.
</li><li>
	Make yourself unnecessary to the running of your business.
</li><li>
	The real point of doing anything is to be happy, so do only what makes you happy.
</li></ul><p>
	What do these statements mean?
	What’s the context?
	How are you supposed to apply them to your own situation?
</p><p>
	Well… I don’t love talking about myself, but for the lessons to make sense, I have to <a href="/a">tell you my tale</a>.
