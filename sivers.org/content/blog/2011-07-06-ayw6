<!-- This ain’t no revolution -->
<p>
	Five years after I started CD Baby, when it was a big success, the media said I had revolutionized the music business.
</p><p>
	But “revolution” is a term that people use only when you’re successful.
	Before that, you’re just a quirky person who does things differently.
</p><p>
	People think revolution needs to involve loud provocations, fists in the air, and bloodshed.
</p><p>
	But if you think true love looks like Romeo and Juliet, you’ll overlook a great relationship that grows slowly.
</p><p>
	If you think your life’s purpose needs to hit you like a lightning bolt, you’ll overlook the little day-to-day things that fascinate you.
</p><p>
	If you think revolution needs to feel like war, you’ll overlook the importance of simply serving people better.
</p><p>
	When you’re on to something great, it won’t feel like revolution.
	It’ll feel like uncommon sense.
