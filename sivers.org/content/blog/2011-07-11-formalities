<!-- Formalities play on fear. Bravely refuse. -->

	A year after starting CD Baby, when it was going pretty well, I got a call from a friend who was setting up his own similar web-based business.
</p><p>
	He said, “Do you have any advice about how to do our ‘Terms & Conditions’ and ‘Privacy Policy’ on the website? Which lawyer did you use for that?”
</p><p>
	I said, “Huh? I don’t have any of that legalese stuff. I’ve never hired a lawyer.”
</p><p>
	Shocked, he said, “That’s crazy! What if some kid buys a CD from you, then kills himself? What if you get sued over that?”
</p><p>
	I said, “Then no stupid footnote legalese would protect me anyway, so I’ll worry about it if it happens.”
</p><p>
	Do you passionately love the “Terms & Conditions” and “Privacy Policy” pages on other websites?
	Have you even read them?
	If not, then why would you go putting that garbage on your website?
</p><p>
	After CD Baby grew to fifty employees, all the business-to-business service companies started pitching me on how I needed an official employee review plan, sensitivity training, “Terms and Conditions” postings, and all this corporate crap.
</p><p>
	I got such joy out of saying no to all of it.
</p><p>
	Never forget that there are thousands of businesses, like “Jim’s Fish Bait Shop” in a shack on a beach somewhere, that are doing just fine without corporate formalities.
</p><p>
	As your business grows, never let the leeches sucker you into all that stuff they pretend you need.
</p><p>
	They’ll play on your fears, saying that you need this stuff to protect yourself against lawsuits.
	They’ll scare you with horrible worst-case scenarios.
	But those are just sales tactics.
	You don’t need any of it.
