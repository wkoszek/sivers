<!-- Why no advertising? -->
<p>
	I got a call from an advertising salesman, saying he’d like to run banner ads at the top and bottom of cdbaby.com.
</p><p>
	I said, “No way. Out of the question. That would be like putting a coke machine in a monastery. I’m not doing this to make money.”
</p><p>
	He asked, “But you’re a business. What do you mean you’re not trying to make money?”
</p><p>
	I said, “I’m just trying to help musicians. CD Baby has to charge money to sustain itself, but the money’s not the point. I don’t do anything for the money.”
</p><p>
	This goes back to the utopian perfect-world ideal of why we’re doing what we’re doing in the first place.
</p><p>
	In a perfect world, would your website be covered with advertising?
</p><p>
	When you ask your customers what would improve your service, has anyone said, “Please fill your website with more advertising”?
</p><p>
	Nope. So don’t do it.
