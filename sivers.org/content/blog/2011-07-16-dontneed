<!-- Like you don’t need the money -->
<p>
	Banks love to lend money to those who don’t need it.
</p><p>
	Record labels love to sign musicians who don’t need their help.
</p><p>
	People fall in love with people who won’t give them the time of day.
</p><p>
	It’s a strange law of human behavior.
	It’s pretty universal.
</p><p>
	If you set up your business like you don’t need the money, people are happier to pay you.
</p><p>
	When someone’s doing something for the money, people can sense it, like a desperate lover.
	It’s a turnoff.
</p><p>
	When someone’s doing something for love, being generous instead of stingy, trusting instead of fearful, it triggers this law:
	We want to give to those who give.
</p><p>
	It’s another Tao of business:
	Set up your business like you don’t need the money, and it’ll likely come your way.
