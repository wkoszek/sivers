	My hiring policy was ridiculous.
</p><p>
	Because I was too busy to bother, I’d just ask my current employees if they had any friends who needed work.
</p><p>
	Someone always did, so I’d say, “Tell them to start tomorrow morning. Ten dollars an hour. Show them what to do.”
	And that was that.
</p><p>
	The thought was that it’s almost impossible to tell what someone’s going to be like on the job until he’s actually on the job for a few weeks.
	So I’d hire lightly and fire lightly.
	Luckily we didn’t need to fire that often.
</p><p>
	But maybe the fact that the new hires were friends of friends helped with the trust part.
</p><p>
	To be fair, this was a mail-order CD store, so most of my employees were in the warehouse.
	But I also took this same casual approach when I needed an important high-tech systems administrator.
</p><p>
	“Anyone have a friend who’s good with Linux? Yeah? Is he cool?  OK, tell him to start tomorrow.”
</p><p>
	The first time I did that I found Ryan.
	The second time, I found Jason.
	Both guys are amazing and are key people at CD Baby to this day.
</p><p>
	Don’t try to impress an invisible jury of MBA professors.
	It’s OK to be casual.
