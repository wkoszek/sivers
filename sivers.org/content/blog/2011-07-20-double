<!-- Prepare to double -->
<p>
	CD Baby doubled in size every year for the first six years.
	Both customers and profit, almost exactly 100 percent growth each year.
</p><p>
	Because the business needed a warehouse for the CDs, I always had to buy more shelving.
	Each time I did, I’d buy twice as much as I had before.
	It always filled up fast, even when it got warehouse-sized.
	When I had filled a 5000-square-foot warehouse, I rented 10,000 square feet.
	When I filled up 10,000 square feet, I rented 20,000 square feet.
	Even that filled up fast.
</p><p>
	But no matter what business you’re in, it’s good to prepare for what would happen if business doubled.
</p><p>
	Have 10 clients now?
	How would it look if you had 20 at once?
	Serving 80 customers for lunch each day?
	What would happen if 160 showed up?
</p><p>
	Notice that “more of the same” is never the answer.
	You’d have to do things in a new way to handle twice as much business.
	Processes would have to be streamlined.
</p><p>
	Never be the typical tragic small business that gets frazzled and freaked out when business is doing well.
	It sends a repulsive “I can’t handle this!” message to everyone.
</p><p>
	Instead, if your internal processes are always designed to handle twice your existing load, it sends an attractive “come on in, we’ve got plenty of room” message to everyone.
