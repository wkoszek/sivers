<!-- Make it anything you want -->
<p>
	After your business has been up and running a while, you’ll hit an interesting crossroads.
</p><p>
	Everyone assumes that as the owner of the company, you’ll be the traditional CEO, having high-powered lunches with other high-powered CEOs and doing all the big business deals.
</p><p>
	But what if you don’t like doing that?
	What if what you love the most is the solitude of the craft?
	Or talking to customers?
</p><p>
	Never forget that you can make your role anything you want it to be.
</p><p>
	Anything you hate to do, someone else loves.
	So find that person and let him do it.
</p><p>
	For me, I loved sitting alone and programming, writing, planning, and inventing.
	Thinking of ideas and making them happen.
	This makes me happy, not business deals or management.
	So I found someone who liked doing business deals and put him in charge of all that.
</p><p>
	If you do this, you’ll encounter a lot of pushback and misunderstanding, but who cares?
	You can’t just live someone else’s expectation of a traditional business.
	You have to just do whatever you love the most, or you’ll lose interest in the whole thing.
</p><p>
	On a similar note, people also assume that you want to be big big big — as big as can be.
	But do you, really?
</p><p>
	Huge growth means lots of meetings, investors, bankers, media, and answering to others.
	It’s quite far from the real core of the business.
</p><p>
	Happiness is the real reason you’re doing anything, right?
	Even if you say it’s for the money, the money is just a means to happiness, right?
	But what if it’s proven that after a certain point, money doesn’t create any happiness at all, but only headaches?
	You may be much happier as a $1 million business than a $1 billion business.
</p><p>
	Funny thing is, I didn’t want CD Baby to grow at all.
	Even from the start, I didn’t want this website hobby to take away from my career as a musician, but it did.
	I didn’t want it to have more than a couple employees or outgrow my house, but it did.
	When I had twenty employees, I vowed to keep it that small, but customer demand kept growing, and I had to keep the customers happy.
	When I had fifty employees, I swore that was enough, and we needed to curb this growth, but the business kept growing.
</p><p>
	When people would ask, “What are you doing to grow your company?”
	I’d say, “Nothing! I’m trying to get it to stop growing! I don’t like this. It’s too big.”
</p><p>
	They thought that was the weirdest thing.
	Doesn’t every business want to be as big as possible?
</p><p>
	No.
	Make sure you know what makes you happy, and don’t forget it.
