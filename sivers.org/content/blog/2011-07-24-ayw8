<!-- You make your perfect world -->
<p>
	I started CD Baby focused on the importance of making a dream-come-true perfect world for musicians.
</p><p>
	Along the way I learned the importance of making my business a dream come true for myself, too.
</p><p>
	Business is as creative as the fine arts.
	You can be as unconventional, unique, and quirky as you want.
	A business is a reflection of the creator.
</p><ul><li>
	Some people want to be billionaires with thousands of employees.
	Some people want to work alone.
</li><li>
	Some want as much profit as possible.
	Some want as little profit as possible.
</li><li>
	Some want to be in Silicon Valley with Fortune 500 customers.
	Some want to be anonymous.
</li></ul><p>
	No matter which goal you choose, there will be lots of people telling you you’re wrong.
</p><p>
	Just pay close attention to what excites you and what drains you.
	Pay close attention to when you’re being the real you and when you’re trying to impress an invisible jury.
</p><p>
	Even if what you’re doing is slowing the growth of your business — if it makes you happy, that’s OK.
	It’s your choice to remain small.
</p><p>
	You’ll notice that as my company got bigger, <a href="/a">my stories about it</a> were less happy.
	That was my lesson learned.
	I’m happier with 5 employees than with 85, and happiest working alone.
</p><p>
	Whatever you make, it’s your creation, so make it your personal dream come true.
