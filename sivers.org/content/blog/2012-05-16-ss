<!-- Smart people don’t think others are stupid -->
<p>
	The woman seemed to be making some pretty good points, until she stopped with, “Ugh! Those <em>(people she disagrees with)</em> are just so stupid!!”
</p><p>
	She could have said Southerners, Northerners, Republicans, Democrats, Indians, or Americans.
	It doesn’t matter.
	She had just proven that she wasn’t being smart.
</p><p>
	There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Being smart means thinking things through.
</strong>
	It means trying to find the real answer, not the easiest answer.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions.
</strong>
	Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game : you lose by default.
</p><p>
	That’s why saying “I don’t know” is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion.
</p><p>
<strong>
	So when someone says, “They are so stupid!” it means they’ve stopped thinking.
</strong>
	They say it because it’s satisfying to jump to that conclusion.
</p><p>
	So if you decide someone is stupid, it means you’re not thinking, which is not being smart.
</p><p>
	Therefore:
<strong>
	Smart people don’t think others are stupid.
