<!-- Everything is my fault -->
<p>
	I hardly ever get mad, but I spent a few years being really mad at my ex-employees.
</p><p>
	They corrupted the culture of the company.
	They tried to stage a mutiny.
	They focused on their benefits instead of our clients.
</p><p>
	They this.
	They that.
	Do you hear the pattern?
</p><p>
	When someone upsets you, it's human nature to feel it's entirely their fault.
</p><p>
	But one day I started thinking maybe it was all my fault.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	I created the environment that let the rotten apples spoil the barrel.
</li>
<li>
	I ignored problems instead of nipping them in the bud.
</li>
<li>
	I was aloof and away instead of managing or training managers.
</li>
<li>
	(I could list many more examples, but you get the idea.)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	It felt so good to decide it was all my fault!
</p><p>
<strong>
	This is way better than forgiving.
</strong>
	When you forgive, you’re still assuming they’re wrong and you're the victim.
	You’re just charitably pardoning their horrible deeds.
</p><p>
	But to decide it’s your fault feels amazing!
	Now you weren’t wronged.
<strong>
	They were just playing their part in the situation you created.
</strong>
	They’re just delivering the punch-line to the joke you set up.
</p><p>
	What power!
	Now you’re like a new super-hero, just discovering your strength.
	Now you’re the powerful person that made things happen, made a mistake, and can learn from it.
	Now you’re in control and there’s nothing to <a href="/complainers">complain</a> about.
</p><p>
	This philosophy feels so good that <strong> I’ve playfully decided to apply this “EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT” rule to the rest of my life.</strong>
</p><p>
	It’s one of those base rules like “people mean well” that’s more fun to believe, and have a few exceptions, than to not believe at all.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	The guy that stole $9000 from me?
<strong>
	My fault.
</strong>
	I should have verified his claims.
</li>
<li>
	The love of my life that suddenly dumped me after six years?
<strong>
	My fault.
</strong>
	I let our relationship plateau.
</li>
<li>
	Don’t like my government?
<strong>
	My fault.
</strong>
	I could get involved and change it.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<strong>
	See what power it is?
</strong>
</p><p>
	Yes, the word “responsibility” is more accurate, but to me that's such a somber serious word, whereas “everything’s my fault” is a fun rule-of-thumb.
</p><p> 
	Try it on.
</p><p>
	Think of every bad thing that happened to you, and imagine you happened to it.
</p><p>
	Cool, huh?
</p><p>
	That power looks good on you.
