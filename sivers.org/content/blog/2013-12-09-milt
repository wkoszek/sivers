<!-- OK, Milt Olin, I’ll start writing again -->
<p>
	Last night I spent far too much time tinkering with setting up both the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> operating systems to dual-boot on my laptop.
</p><p>
	This morning I found out one of my best friends died yesterday.
	He was in great health, was out on a bike ride on a quiet street, and a car swerved into the bike lane, <a href="http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/12/08/bicyclist-struck-and-killed-by-sheriffs-radio-car-in-calabasas/">killing him instantly</a>.
</p><p>
	I let him share my online music account.
	He had just downloaded the entire Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young catalog yesterday before he left on his ride.
</p><p>
	I’ve been crying off and on all morning, thinking about the things we do with our time.
	What’s worthy and what’s a waste.
</p><p>
	It really is limited.
	We can’t pretend it’s not.
	Time spent doing one thing is time spent not doing something else.
</p><p>
	It’s so easy to waste time doing that stuff that’s of no importance, no challenge, no benefit to anyone, not even yourself.
</p><p>
	It’s so hard to fight the <a href="/book/WarOfArt">resistance</a> to do the more difficult but more important thing.
	Finishing that book.
	Writing that song.
	Launching that project.
</p><p>
	I spent this morning thinking about what doesn’t matter and what does.
	For me, <strong>writing</strong> is about the most worthy thing I can do with my time.
	I love how the distributed word is eternal - that every day I get emails from strangers thanking me for things I wrote years ago that helped them today.
	I love how those things will continue to help people long after I’m gone.
</p><p>
	So this lesson is dedicated to you, Milt.
	I’m going to start writing again.
