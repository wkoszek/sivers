<!-- Why am I here? -->
<p>
	Looking around the room.
</p><p>
	“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
	It’s a useful question to ask often.
</p><p>
	Either it will <strong>re-focus</strong> your reasons for being where you are, or it will make you realize your reasons have <strong>expired</strong> and you should be somewhere else.
</p><p>
	In a little apartment in Singapore, I ask it again.
</p><p>
	“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
	Because of the brilliant and fascinating people here.
</p><p>
<em>
	(But I’m refusing all requests to meet, to stay focused on my work.
	For the past 3 years I was very social, but now I’m not.)
</em>
</p><p>
	Because I love learning about Asia, and Singapore is a great central home base for that.
</p><p>
<em>
	(But I’m not exploring Asia right now.
	For the past 3 years I was, but now I’m inwardly-focused on my writing and programming.)
</em>
</p><p>
	Because I love and admire it, and it feels like home.
</p><p>
<em>
	(But I’ve loved everywhere I’ve lived, from California to New York to London to Portland.
	They’ve all felt like home.
	Future places will feel like home, too.)
</em>
</p><p>
	Because I’m here right now.
</p><p>
<em>
	(But there are airplanes.
	You can sit in them.)
</em>
</p><p>
<strong>
	Most of us are where we are because of decisions we made years ago.
	But are those reasons still current for what we need now?
	Ask again.
</strong>
</p><p>
	“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
	Damn.
	I ran out of reasons.
	I should be somewhere else.
</p><p>
	I want silence, solitude, and wide open spaces.
</p><p>
	I want to work all day while listening to nothing but birds and wind in the trees.
</p><p>
	I want an intentional lack of distractions, far far away, to cure my tendency to say yes to intellectually stimulating events.
</p><p>
	So the answer was clear.
</p><p>
	I moved to New Zealand’s South Island.
</p><p>
	<a href="http://www.newzealand.com/">Here</a> I am.
</p><p>
	“Why am I here?”
</p><p>
	To work.
	To focus.
	To write.
	To code.
	To launch.
</p><p>
	Yes.
	Good answer.
