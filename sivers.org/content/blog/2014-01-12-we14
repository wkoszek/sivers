	These 2014 editions were <strong>all written in the last three months, based on research from the last six months.</strong>
	They’re the most current and thorough guides of their kind.
</p><p>
	The 2013 editions were OK, but I never promoted them because I wanted them to be deeper, more thorough, and more insightful.
	But these 2014 editions were created by some amazing researchers and writers, so I can now proudly say these books are really very good.
</p><p>
	I’ll have more to say about them in the coming weeks.
</p><p>
	But for now, I just want to say <a href="https://woodegg.com/">they’re here</a>.
	Two years of effort by over 140 people.
	I’m so thrilled, and honestly a little in awe of what we’ve created.
</p><p>
	I hope you <a href="https://woodegg.com/">buy one</a>, and hope you like it.
