<!-- Imitate. We are imperfect mirrors. -->

	You know that song you love, that you wish you wrote?
	Copy it.
</p><p>
	You know that existing business, that you wish you had thought of?
	Copy it.
</p><p>
	Why?
</p><p>
	Because humans are imperfect mirrors.
</p><p>
	Like a funhouse mirror that distorts what it reflects, even if you try to imitate something, it will turn out much different than the original.
	Maybe better.
</p><p>
	When a musician covers someone else’s song, they clearly reveal their own warped perspective, since we know what the original sounds like.
	Because of this, a cover song is actually a great way to define who you are as an artist.
</p><p>
	When a musician writes a new song, imitating someone else’s song, it’s usually unrecognizable.
	You have to tell people of its inspiration, for them to make the connection.
</p><p>
	So an entrepreneur can imitate someone else’s business, and still be adding a unique service to the world.

<strong>
	I resisted this lesson as long as I could.
</strong>
	It offended my instincts as an artist.
	I felt that everything I did had to be 100% original.
	Everything “not invented here” was out of the question.
</p><p>
	Back in my CD Baby days, my only direct competitor had one awesome advantage: old fashioned credit card swiping machines that musicians could use to sell CDs at gigs, even without electricity or a 3G connection.
	Musicians would tell me how much they loved that service, and even told me they wish we had it too.
	I said, “Yeah. Damn. Oh well.”
	Because imitating their offering didn’t even enter my mind.
</p><p>
	It took a whole year for me to swallow my pride, and realize I’d be doing my clients a favor if I imitated that idea.
<strong>
	It turned out to be one of the most successful things I ever did.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Those little credit card swiping machines charged over $8.5 million for thousands of musicians, which meant $7.75 million paid out to the musicians, and $750k profit for us.
	And the whole thing only took two weeks to make, and one employee to run.
</p><p>

</p><p>
	So look around at those existing ideas in the world.
</p><p>
	Get over that self-important resistance, and do the world a favor.
