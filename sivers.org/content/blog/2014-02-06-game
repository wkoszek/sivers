<!-- How will this game end? -->
<p>
	Imagine I announce <strong>I am going to sell a $100 bill by auction, and the bidding starts at only $1.</strong>
</p><p>
	The only rule of the game is this:
	<strong>If you are the 2nd-highest bidder, you still have to pay what you bid</strong>, but you don’t get the $100 bill. 
</p><p>
	Of course I get some bids for $1, $2, $3.
	Why not?  Hey - a chance to get $100 for $3!
</p><p>
	The bids keep coming in.
	By $51 I’m happy - I’m going to profit now.
</p><p>
	Once they get to $90, there’s less enthusiasm, but reason to stay in.
</p><p>
	Once they get to $99, though, the person offering $98 thinks, “Uh oh. The other person isn’t backing down,” and raises their bid to $100 so as not to be 2nd-lowest and lose the entire $98.
</p><p>
	But now the person offering $99 raises their bid to $101.
	Better to lose only $1 than $99, right?
</p><p>
	Soon they’re offering $110, $120, $150.
	This game could go on forever.
</p><p>
<strong>
	The real problem: not thinking it through in advance.
</strong>
</p><p>
	When the game starts, it’s easy to think short-term and say, “Ooh! Good deal!”
</p><p>
	Then when it’s too late, you slowly realize, ”Uh-oh. What have I done?”
</p><p>
<strong>
	A lot of people get into life situations like this.
</strong>
</p><p>
	The entrepreneur who borrows a lot of money to test an idea.
</p><p>
	The homeowner who bought a house at the top end of their budget.
</p><p>
	The romantic who gets into a relationship with someone who is already in a relationship.
</p><p>
	You can hear them whining about how they’re so in debt, or their sweetheart is cheating.
</p><p>
	Oops!  Didn’t think that one through, huh?
</p><p>
	The game was clearly rigged against them, so the smart choice is to not play that game at all.
	We should always ask, “How will this game end?”
</p><p>
<strong>
	It’s <em>hard</em> to think through the long-term implications of everything we’re doing now.
</strong>
</p><p>
	It’s hard, but it’s worth the effort.
	I’m just posting this here as a reminder to myself, too.
