<!-- Change careers like Tarzan -->
<p>
	I get emails from many people who want to make a big change in their career.
</p><p>
	Each one wants to quit their current career, and boldly leap into their new venture or preferred lifestyle.
</p><p>
	When they ask my advice, they think I’m going to say, “Yes! Quit! Go for it!”
</p><p>
	But instead, they’re surprised at my suggestion:
</p><p>
	Remember how Tarzan swings through the jungle?
	He doesn’t let go of the previous vine until the next vine is supporting his weight.
</p><p>

</p><p>
	So my advice is: Change careers like Tarzan.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Don’t let go of the old one until the new one is supporting you.
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	And make sure you don’t lose momentum.

	P.S.  I highly recommend reading the book “<a href="/book/SoGood">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>” for more thoughts on this.
