<!-- Loving what I used to hate -->
<p>
	From now on, when I say I hate something, remind me to add “<strong>… today</strong>” to the sentence.
</p><p>
	Here’s why:
</p>

<h3>
	Tom Waits
</h3>
<p>
	The first time I heard Tom Waits was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEttHwPXARk">on David Letterman</a>.
</p><p>
	I hated it.
	I hated it passionately.
	I complained to my friend that it was the worst thing I’d ever heard, and it must be some kind of joke.
</p><p>
	The second time I heard Tom Waits was a year later, when my roommate played me the song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0I4k9qqAjA">Singapore</a>”, and I hated it just as much.
	I still thought it must be some kind of joke.
	Maybe it’s a dare, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%A1karl">hákarl</a>?
	Someone wouldn’t actually listen to this for pleasure, would they?
</p><p>
	The third time I heard Tom Waits was his cover of the Cole Porter song “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RASG2JmtDeQ">It’s All Right With Me</a>”, and <strong>suddenly I got it</strong>.
	Maybe it’s <a href="/mirror">because it’s a cover</a>, or maybe I was sick of all normal music that day, but his American exotic theatrical junkyard sound was just what I needed.
</p><p>
	Then I bought the great <a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Rain+Dogs">Rain Dogs</a> album, and it’s one of my favorite albums of all time.
	(Especially “<a href="http://www.last.fm/music/Tom+Waits/Rain+Dogs/Tango+Till+They%27re+Sore">Tango Till They’re Sore</a>”, which I hated before, and now love the most.)
</p>

<h3>
	Indonesia
</h3>
<p>
	The best TEDx Conference I’ve ever been to was in <a href="http://www.tedxjakarta.org/">Jakarta, Indonesia</a>.
</p><p>
	From the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdVLYMb8IGE">cross-gender dancer</a> to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRVrm3svaUk">leader of games</a>, I got such an <strong>overwhelming dose of Indonesian talent, culture, and pride that day</strong>, that a part of me will forever feel Indonesian, or at least a big fan.
</p><p>
	A week later, I had to laugh when I suddenly remembered that I used to hate Indonesia!  Why?
</p><p>
	Because at my old company, CD Baby, whenever we’d get a big order from Indonesia, and ship the CDs across the world, the credit card company would contact me months later to tell me that order was placed with a stolen credit card.
	Every time, it was Indonesia.
	Small orders, big orders, every one of them was always credit card fraud.
	I lost thousands of dollars before I finally had to block all Indonesian visitors to cdbaby.com, and silently delete any orders with an Indonesia shipping address.
	I remember cursing that “nation of thieves” and its horrible inhabitants.
	I’m sure at the time you couldn’t have paid me to go to that awful place.
</p><p>
	Oops.
	Wrong.
	Once I <a href="/id14">got to know it</a>, I loved it.
</p>

<h3>
	Weight lifting
</h3>
<p>
	Ever since high school, when I was solidly in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freaks_and_Geeks">freaks</a>” category, I’ve made fun of people who spend a lot of time at the gym, lifting weights.
	Stupid jocks, mindlessly lifting pieces of metal.
</p><p>
	A few years ago, some people I know all recommended <a href="http://www.mensjournal.com/magazine/print-view/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie-20120504">old-fashioned barbell training</a> as a great all-around fitness habit.
</p><p>
	I tried it, and they were right.
	I love it.
	Three times a week, I’m in the gym (for only 40 minutes), doing squats and deadlifts, <a href="http://startingstrength.com/about">as described here</a>.
</p><p>
	I have to smile, thinking what my former self would say.
</p><p>
	But the former self is not always right
</p><p>
<strong>
	We don’t need to preserve our first opinions as if they are our pure, untarnished, true nature.
</strong>
	They’re often just ignorance or inexperience.
</p><p>
	Now when I catch myself saying that I hate (or love!) something, I try to remember to add “<strong>… today</strong>” to the end of the sentence.
</p><p>
	Opinions are likely to change at any time, but are much harder to change if you’ve carved out your self-identity, declaring “<em>This</em> is what I love! <em>That</em> is what I hate!”
</p><p>
	Though I’m happy to say this is what I hate or love <strong>today</strong>.
