<!-- I love being wrong -->
<p>
	Most of the time I feel smart, successful, and driven - like I’ve got it all figured out.
</p><p>
	But last month a bunch of stuff knocked me on my ass.
	I’ve never felt so wrong.
</p><p>
	I vulnerably called on friends for help.
</p><ul><li>
	Amber reminded me to pull my head out of today, and think <a href="/time">long-term</a> again.
</li><li>
	Jeff told me to get my swagger back and relish the moment.
</li><li>
	Ariel said I should really accept and feel this pain, instead of moving on so fast like I always do.
</li></ul>
<p>
	Each different perspective made me feel good for a while, then I’d fall back into the whirlpool of destructive thoughts.
</p><p>
	Whenever something’s wrong in my life, I’ve asked myself this amazing question:
</p><p>
<strong>
	“What’s great about this?”
</strong>
</p><p>
	But now my only answer was, “Nothing. This just sucks.”
	I tried asking it again every day or two, but the answer was the same.
	Down the whirlpool I went.
</p><p>
	After moping at the bottom of the ocean for a few weeks, I got a bright memory from my former self.
</p><p>
	<strong>I actually love being wrong</strong>, even though it cracks my confidence, <strong>because that’s the only time I learn.</strong>
</p><p>
	<strong>I actually love being lost</strong>, even though it fuels fears, <strong>because that’s when I go somewhere unexpected.</strong>
</p><p>
	<a href="/book">I pursue these things</a> in small digestable doses.
	I love little lessons that surprise my expectations and <a href="http://www.samharris.org/blog/item/the-fireplace-delusion">change my mind</a>.
<em>
	This is why I aim to make <a href="http://www.ted.com/speakers/derek_sivers#talks">my TED talks</a> surprising.
	If we’re not surprised, we’re not learning.
</em>
</p><p>
	But I finally answered “What’s great about this?”:
</p><p>
	Getting knocked on my ass made me humble as hell.
	It’s been years since I’d called for help.
	It’s been years since my <a href="http://truecenterpublishing.com/zenstory/emptycup.html">cup was so empty</a>.
	It’s been years since I was so open to advice. 
</p><p>
	I smiled, thinking of how much I’ve learned from my friends these past few weeks.
	I realized how ultimately happy it makes me to be so empty, even if it really hurts at first.
<strong>
	It’s better than thinking I’ve got it all figured out.
</strong>
</p><p>
	And with that, the sun came up and the whirlpool went away.
</p><p>
	Thank you life.
	Thank you friends.
