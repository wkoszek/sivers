<!-- Fixed mindset vs Growth mindset -->
<p>
	One of the most important concepts I’ve learned is the difference between the “fixed” mindset and the “growth” mindset.
</p><p>
	It’s a little bit like “nature vs nurture”:
</p><p>
	People in a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset believe you either are or aren’t good at something, based on your inherent nature, because it’s just who you are.
</p><p>
	People in a <strong>growth</strong> mindset believe anyone can be good at anything, because your abilities are entirely due to your actions.
</p><p>
	This sounds simple, but it’s surprisingly deep.
	<strong>The fixed mindset is the most common and the most harmful</strong>, so it’s worth understanding and considering how it’s affecting you.
</p><p>
	For example:
</p><p>
	In a fixed mindset, you believe “She’s a natural born singer” or “I’m just no good at dancing.”
</p><p>
	In a growth mindset, you believe “Anyone can be good at anything. Skill comes only from practice.”
</p><p>
<strong>
	The fixed mindset believes trouble is devastating.
</strong>
	If you believe, “You’re either naturally great or will never be great,” then when you have any trouble, your mind thinks, “See? You’ll never be great at this. Give up now.”
</p><p>
	The growth mindset believes trouble is just important feedback in the learning process.
</p><p>
	Can you see how this subtle difference in mindset can change everything?
</p>
<p><strong>
	More examples:
</strong></p>
<p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, you want to hide your flaws so you’re not judged or labeled a failure.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, your flaws are just a TO-DO list of things to improve.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, you stick with what you know to keep up your confidence.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, you keep up your confidence by always pushing into the unfamiliar, to make sure you’re always learning.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, you look inside yourself to find your true passion and purpose, as if this is a hidden inherent thing.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, you commit to mastering valuable skills regardless of mood, knowing passion and purpose come from doing great work, which comes from expertise and experience.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, failures define you.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, failures are temporary setbacks.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, you believe if you’re romantically compatible with someone, you should share all of eachother’s views, and everything should just come naturally.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, you believe a lasting relationship comes from effort and working through inevitable differences.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>fixed</strong> mindset, it’s all about the outcome. If you fail, you think all effort was wasted.
</p><p>
	In a <strong>growth</strong> mindset, it’s all about the process, so the outcome hardly matters.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, the mindset itself is not fixed.
	You can change your mindset just by thinking it through.
</p><p>
	I’ve talked about this in <a href="/ml">my “Meaning of Life” talk</a>, and <a href="/failure">my “Why You Need to Fail” talk</a>, if you’re interested in checking those out, too.
</p><p>
	But I get no credit for these insights.
	This is all from <a href="/book/Mindset">Carol Dweck’s book, “Mindset”</a>, and <a href="/book/ArtOfLearning">Josh Waitzkin’s book, “The Art of Learning”</a>, both of which I highly recommend.
