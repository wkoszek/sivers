<!-- How to change or build your career -->
<p>
	I get emails from many people wanting to change or build their career.
	I always recommend the best book on the subject: “<a href="/book/SoGood">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>” by Cal Newport.
	Here are a few of its best points:
</p>
<h2>
	Forget passion and purpose
</h2>
<p>
	Forget “follow your passion” or “find your true calling”.
	Stop thinking like that.
	Here’s why:
</p><p>
	Words like “passion” and “purpose” are dangerous because they sound huge and romantic.
	If you think you haven’t found your passion yet, you’re probably <strong>expecting it to be overwhelming</strong> — to hit you like lightning.
</p><p>
	Looking for your passion, purpose, or calling is an example of the <a href="/mindset">fixed mindset</a>.
	You’re assuming that this is an inherent and unchanging thing inside of you, like trying to read your DNA or blood type.
	But you won’t find passion and purpose there, because <strong>that’s not where those feelings come from.</strong>
</p><p>
	Passion and purpose are <strong>emotions that come after expertise and experience.</strong>
	The way to get them is to commit to <a href="/book/Mastery">the path of mastery</a>, get great at something, and do great work.
</p><p>
	So instead of looking for passion and purpose, just keep mastering whatever work you’ve started, becoming more and more valuable in your field.
	Passion and purpose will follow a great career.
</p>

<h2>
	Great careers are only for the rare and valuable
</h2>
<p>
	Think of what makes a great career:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	good pay
</li>
<li>
	room to grow
</li>
<li>
	freedom and control
</li>
<li>
	positive impact
</li>
<li>
	emotionally rewarding
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	Jobs like this are rare and valuable.
	A great career isn’t something you <strong>find</strong> - it’s something you <strong>earn</strong> when you’ve got <strong>rare and valuable skills to offer in return.</strong>
</p><p>
	In other words, you can only earn a great career by building your expertise and experience.
</p>

<h2>
	Solution: focus on the craft, not passion.
</h2>
<p>
	The solution to this problem is what’s called “the craftman’s path” — the long-term path to mastery.
</p><p>
	Everyone who became great at something has a similar story:
	For years, they worked on their craft every day, even if they weren’t in the mood.
	Always pushing, practicing, working, and improving.
</p><p>
	It doesn’t matter if you’re feeling passionate about it that day or even that month.
	You keep working and keep improving.
</p><p>
	It doesn’t matter whether your work environment is ideal or you’re being wonderfully rewarded yet.
	You keep working and keep improving.
</p><p>
	Yes it takes thousands of hours of practice, but that’s good news!
	<strong>It’s a clear path and it’s under your control</strong>, instead of dwelling on unanswerable questions like “What is my true calling?”
</p><p>
	You forget the self-centered concerns about your passion and purpose, and instead just keep improving and getting really damn good.
</p><p>
	It doesn’t matter if your current job isn’t perfect.
	<strong>You just keep improving</strong>, no matter where you are, <strong>becoming more and more valuable</strong>.
</p><p>
	By building your skills, experience, and value, you earn a great career.
</p><p>
	By building your skills, experience, and value, <strong>passion and purpose come to you</strong>.
</p><p>
	By building your skills, experience, and value, you are building your “career capital”.
</p>

<h2>
	Career capital: use it to make a change
</h2>
<p>
	“Career capital” is a metaphor.
	Think of it like gold tokens you’re earning over years of building your expertise, experience, connections, and reputation.
</p><p>
	The important point is to <strong>remember how valuable it is</strong>.
</p><p>
	When you want to make a change to your career, you spend this career capital you’ve earned.
</p><p>
	But if you’re really sick of your current field and want to switch to another field, <strong>don’t just quit and throw away all the career capital you’ve built up!</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	If you’re thinking of quitting your job to follow your passion, please don’t miss this point!
</strong>
</p><p>
	Think of ways you can <strong>use the value you’ve built up</strong> to make the transition to another field.
</p><p>
	<a href="/tarzan">Like Tarzan</a>, use your connections, reputation, experience, and expertise to <strong>transition</strong> into a better situation in the new field before leaving the old one.
</p><p>
	Realize the career capital you’ve built up already, and don’t just throw it away.
</p>

<h2>
	Starting from scratch?
</h2>
<p>
	If you’re starting from scratch anyway, jump into any growing field and start building your skills, expertise, connections, and reputation.
	Pick a niche and dominate it.
