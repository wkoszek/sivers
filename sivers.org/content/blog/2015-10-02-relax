<!-- Relax for the same result -->
<p>
	A few years ago, I lived in Santa Monica, California, right on the beach.
</p><p>
	There’s a great bike path that goes along the ocean for 7½ miles.
	So, 15 miles round trip.
</p><p>
	On weekday afternoons, it’s almost empty.
	It’s perfect for going full-speed.
</p><p>
	So a few times a week, I’d get on <a href="http://surlybikes.com/bikes/pacer">my bike</a> and go as fast as I could for the 15 mile loop.
	I mean really full-on, 100%, head-down, red-faced, sprinting.
</p><p>
	I’d finish exhausted, and look at the time.
<strong>
	43 minutes.
</strong>
	Every time.
	Maybe a minute more on a really windy day.
	But basically always 43 minutes.
</p><p>
	After a few months, I noticed I was getting less enthusiastic about this bike ride.
	I think I had mentally linked it with being completely exhausted.
</p><p>
	So one day I decided <strong>I would do the same ride, but just chill</strong>.
	Take it easy, nice and slow.
	OK not <em>super</em>-slow, but dialing it back to about 50% of my usual effort.
</p><p>
	And ahhh....
	What a fun ride.
	I was relaxed, and smiling, and looking around.
	Not red-faced.
	I was barely giving it any effort.
</p><p>
	I saw two dolphins in the water.
	A pelican flew right over me in Marina del Ray.
	When I looked up to say “wow!”, he shit in my mouth.
	I can still remember that taste of digested shellfish.
	I had to laugh at the novelty of it.
</p><p>
	I’m usually so damn driven, always doing everything as intensely as I can.
	It was so nice to take it easy for once.
	I felt I could do this forever, without any exhaustion.
</p><p>
	When I finished, I looked at the time.
<strong>
	45 minutes.
</strong>
</p><p>
	What?!? How could that be?
	Yep. I double-checked.
	45 minutes, as compared to my usual 43.
</p><p>
	So apparently all of that exhausting, red-faced, full-on push-push-push I had been doing only gave me a <strong>4%</strong> boost.
</p><p>
	I could just take it easy, and get <strong>96% of the results</strong>.
</p><p>
	And what a difference in experience!
	To go the <em>same</em> distance, in about the <em>same</em> time, but one way leaves me exhausted, and the other way rejeuvenated.
</p><p>
	This was really profound for me, and I think of it often.
</p><p>
	When I notice I’m all stressed-out about something, or driving myself to exhaustion, I remember that bike ride, and try dialing back my effort by 50%.
</p><p>
	It’s been amazing how often everything gets done just as well and just as fast, with what <em>feels</em> like 50% of the effort.
</p><p>
	Which, of course, makes me realize that much of my effort apparently wasn’t effort at all, but just ineffective stress added on top of something to make it <em>feel</em> like I’m doing the best I can.
