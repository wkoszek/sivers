	A month ago I announced <a href="/nowff">the /now page movement</a>, where many personal websites are adding a “/now” page to answer the question, “What are you focused on now?”
</p><p>
	At the time, only ten websites had a /now page.
	Now there are over 280.
</p><p>
	It’s incredible.
	People are saying it helps them prioritize and focus.
</p><p>
	<a href="http://gregalbritton.com/now">Greg Albritton</a> emailed to say he made a list of everyone with a /now page.
	So I turned that into its own website: <strong><a href="http://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a></strong>.
</p><p>
	It’s been a fun programming project.
	I’ve been doing it full-time for the past month.
	<a href="https://code.sivers.org/nownownow.com/">See the code</a>, if interested.
	It’s all open source.
	(Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/SaschaKrause">Sascha Krause</a> in Berlin for contributing a better design.)
</p><p>
	Then Greg wanted to do feature profiles, so he came up with six questions that I asked everyone.
	Now if you click the (+) by any link on <a href="http://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>, it will bring you to a page where you can get to know the person behind the site.
</p><p>
	It’s addicting and inspiring to browse these profiles, and visit their sites.
	There’s a Twitter account — <a href="https://twitter.com/NowNowNow">@NowNowNow</a> — that tweets out a link to a new profile every hour.
</p><p>
	People have told me they are getting a good amount of traffic to their site from people browsing <a href="http://nownownow.com/">nownownow.com</a>, so…
</p>
<h2>
	How to add yours?
</h2>
<p>
	<strong>If you already have a website</strong>, just add a new page.
	If you’re using WordPress, look for “Pages” on the left, and choose “Add New”.
	Give it a “permalink” of /now.
	(Sorry I can’t help with tech support.)
</p><p>
	Write something about what you’re doing now, and publish.
	<strong>Once it’s online, email me the link at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a>, and I’ll add it to nownownow.com.</strong>
	After it’s up, I’ll ask you the questions for a profile page.
</p><p>
	<strong>If you don’t have a website</strong>, but have been meaning to get one, create a free one at <a href="https://wordpress.com/">wordpress.com</a>.
	Before you announce it, I highly recommend getting your own domain name at <a href="https://www.hover.com/">hover.com</a>.
	Point your domain to your WordPress blog, and use that.
	(Again, sorry I can’t help with tech support, but this is very common stuff, so anyone else can.)
</p>
<h2>
	What now?
</h2>
<p>
	Someone asked me what my vision is for the /now page movement.
	But I’ve never had one.
	I just enjoy being of service.
<strong>
	People tell me what they want, and if it’s something I can do, I do.
</strong>
</p><p>
	So if you have a good idea for what this could use or could be, please leave a comment here, or email me at <a href="mailto:derek@sivers.org">derek@sivers.org</a>.
