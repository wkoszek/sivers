<!-- How to learn JavaScript -->
<p>
	Since I’ve <a href="/prog">mentioned</a> that I recently learned JavaScript, people have asked me how and what I recommend.
	So here’s my experience and best advice for 2016.
</p><h3>
	Learn plain JavaScript
</h3><p>
	First, it’s important to <strong>learn plain JavaScript</strong>.
</p><p>
	Don’t depend on jQuery, CoffeeScript, or any other library of shortcuts.
	JavaScript will be around for many years, while libraries and frameworks come and go every year.
</p><h3>
	How to begin
</h3><p>
	Don’t just learn from little bits of tutorials, tips, or tricks online.
	Instead, you want a real foundation and solid understanding.
	Then all your future learning will be so much faster.
</p><p><strong>
	Start with the book:
“<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do">Head First HTML5 Programming</a>”.
</strong></p><p>
	It’s a great introduction with a fun teaching style, which is important to get you familiar with something so new.
	Just read through it quickly in a couple days, before your deeper learning begins.
	(You must get the paper book or PDF, because the detailed pictures are necessary.)
</p><p><strong>
	Do <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>.
</strong></p><p>
	Someone who had 600 JavaScript learners <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11048409">said</a> Free Code Camp had the best results.
	Do it at the same time as you’re reading the books.
	Learning sticks better when coming through different senses.
</p><h3>
	Now get deep
</h3><p><strong>
	Simultaneously begin the huge but awesome book:
“<a href="http://www.wrox.com/WileyCDA/WroxTitle/Professional-JavaScript-for-Web-Developers-3rd-Edition.productCd-1118222199.html">Professional JavaScript for Web Developers, 3rd Edition - by Nicholas Zakas</a>”.
</strong></p><p>
	It’s the ultimate tutorial.
	It takes the time to explain everything thoroughly, and covers everything.
<strong>
	By the time you’re done with this one book, you’ll know as much as most people who call themselves JavaScript programmers.
</strong></p><h3>
	Make it stick
</h3><p>
	I highly recommend you <strong>write down every new thing you learn</strong>, ideally into a flashcard program, <a href="/srs">like this</a>.
	It’s a lot to digest, so you’ll have to remind yourself of what you’ve learned, or you’ll immediately forget.
</p><h3>
	Reinforce it
</h3><p>
	Afterwards, if you want to solidify what you’ve learned, quickly read through a few more books like these:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do">JavaScript: The Good Parts - by Douglas Crockford</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596806149.do">JavaScript Cookbook - by Shelley Powers</a></li>
<li><a href="http://effectivejs.com/">Effective JavaScript - by David Herman</a></li>
<li><a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do">Functional JavaScript - by Michael Fogus</a></li>
</ul><p>
	<strong>These books will go faster</strong>, now that you’re fluent.
	Play around with the examples.
	There will be no huge surprises.
	You’re just enhancing what you know.
</p><h3>
	Avoid the shortcuts
</h3><p>
	When solving a problem, everyone will point you to some pre-made solution.
	“Use jQuery! Use Backbone! Use this library and save yourself some typing!”
</p><p><strong>
	But no!
	Not yet!
	Do it the hard way.
	Solve everything yourself with plain JavaScript.
</strong>
	It’s the best way to learn.
</p><h3>
	What next?
</h3><p>
	If you had a web app in mind, start building it now.
	(OK, you can use shortcuts.)
</p><p>
	If you had an iPhone or Android app in mind, learn <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a>.
</p><p>
	If you want a good-paying job, you can <a href="/gethired">get hired</a> almost anywhere.
	Since you know the real JavaScript foundations more than most people, you’re very valuable.
	You can quickly learn whatever framework they’re using.
