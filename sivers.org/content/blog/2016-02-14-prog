<!-- Should you learn programming? Yes. -->
<p>
	When I was 14 years old, my guitar teacher told me something important:
</p><p><strong>
	“You need to learn to sing. Because if you don’t, you’re always going to be at the mercy of some asshole singer.”
</strong></p><p>
	His point was about self-reliance.
	If you ever have any ideas, whether for songs or apps, you need to have some basic skills to turn those ideas into reality.
</p><p>
	One of the most common things I hear from aspiring entrepreneurs is, <strong>“I have this idea for an app or site. But I’m not technical, so I need to find someone who can make it for me.”</strong>
</p><p>
	I point them to my advice about <a href="/how2hire">how to hire a programmer</a>, but most programmers are already busy and expensive.
</p><p>
	Imagine if someone said, “I have this idea for a song.  But I’m not musical, so I need to find someone who will write, perform, and record it for me.”
</p><p>
	You’d probably advise them to just learn enough guitar or piano so they can play their song.
</p><p><strong>
	It’s like learning to drive or make dinner.
	You only need to learn enough so you’re not helpless.
</strong></p><p>
	So, yes, you should learn some programming.
	Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are enough to start.
</p><p><strong>
	I recommend <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596159924.do">Head First HTML and CSS</a> first, then <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920010906.do">Head First HTML5 Programming</a>.
</strong>
	Those are very fun, visual books where you need to see the detailed illustrations, so get the paper book or PDF.
</p><p>
	If you prefer a course and community, use <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>.
	Ideally, do those books and this course at the same time, to really reinforce what you’re learning.
</p><p>
	You could go through those books or courses in a few weeks, and you’d already know as much as half of the people that call themselves web developers.
</p><p>
	It’s a really amazing feeling.
	The mystery is lifted.
	You’ll look at all websites in a new way.
	You’ll understand what’s going on behind the scenes.
	You’ll know how to do it yourself.
	It’s really empowering.
	(It’s definitely been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever learned.)
