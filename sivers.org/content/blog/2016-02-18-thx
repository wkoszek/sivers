<!-- How to take a compliment -->
<p>
	You would think this would be a basic life skill, but it seems almost nobody knows it, so please spread the word.
</p><p><strong>
	When someone gives you a compliment, what should you do?
</strong></p><p>
	Do you say, “What? No! Not at all. That’s ridiculous.”
	Do you give details of why you disagree?
</p><p>
	That’s what most people do.
	They refuse it.
	They deny it.
</p><p>
	But think of how <strong>inconsiderate</strong> that is.
</p><p>
	It takes <strong>courage</strong> to give you a compliment.
	It’s a little <strong>vulnerable</strong> for someone to admit they like something about you, and then to go up to you and tell you so.
	So when they do, is that nice of you to <strong>argue</strong> with them about it?
	How do you think that makes them feel in that moment?
</p><p>
	So, when someone gives you a compliment, what should you do?
</p><p><strong>
	Just say, “Thank you.”
</strong></p><p>
	Nothing more.
</p><p>
	It feels strange, but it’s the right thing to do.
</p><p>
	It doesn’t mean you agree.
	You’re just thanking them for their vulnerable courage in that moment, for taking the trouble to tell you something nice.
</p><p>
	Then sincerely return their interest.
	Ask their name, or something more about them.
</p><p>
	This advice came from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingston_Taylor">Livingston Taylor</a>, and was originally aimed at musicians, since they often get compliments after a gig, and always actively disagree with these compliments.
	But everyone can use this simple life skill.
