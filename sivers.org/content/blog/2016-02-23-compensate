<!-- Over-compensate to compensate -->
<p>
	You have something you want to change: a thought process or habit you want to fix.
</p><p>
	Let’s use the metaphor of a bunch of bricks on a seesaw.
	Right now all the bricks are stacked on one side.
	This is the way you have been.
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-l.jpg">
<p>
	To make a change, <strong>most people don’t do enough.</strong>
</p><p>
	If you do something small and sensible, it’s like moving one brick.
	You’re still unbalanced.
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-l1.jpg">
<p>
	You think you made the change, but it’s not accounting for:
</p><ul><li>
	a lifetime of doing it the other way
</li><li>
	your environment that made you that way
</li><li>
	the pressure from friends to stay that way
</li><li>
	and the undertow of old habits.
</li></ul><p>
	So, <strong>to make a change, you have to be extreme</strong>.
	Go all the way the other way.
	<strong>It will feel like over-compensating</strong>, but you have to stack a huge pile of bricks on the other side.
</p>

<p>
	This new you sounds extreme and exciting.
	You will think you’re going to be completely changed.
</p><p>
	But actually the old stuff is still there.
	So really this is what you needed to do to balance, to compensate for that cultural baggage, self-identity, habit, and history.
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-b.jpg">
<p>
	Once balanced, it will sink in, and become your new normal.

	Example:
</h2>
<p>
	You have a tendency to blame others for your situation.
	We all do this.
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-l.jpg">
<p>
	You realize this is hurting your life.
	You think, “I shouldn’t do that so much. I should take some responsibility.”
</p><p>
	So you try to make some changes:
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-l1.jpg">
<p>
	Nope.
	That’s not good enough.
	Still unbalanced.
<strong>
	You need to go to a further extreme, in a way that will feel like over-compensating.
</strong></p><p>
	You need to think, “Absolutely everything is my fault. All of it. It’s my fault the world is the way it is. It’s my fault the government isn’t exactly to my liking. It’s my responsibility to fix everything I don’t love. It’s my fault that others act the way they do towards me.”
</p><p>
	Sounds extreme, right?
	It will feel like this:
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-r.jpg">
<p>
	You try to think this new way.
	Sometimes you really can.
</p><p>
	But you still can’t help feeling that some things are not your fault.
</p>
<img src="/images/compensate-b.jpg">
<p>
	That’s OK.
	Now you’re balanced.
	This sinks in and becomes your new normal way of thinking.

	The best and most effective changes I’ve made in my life seemed crazy at first, because they seemed to be over-compensating.
