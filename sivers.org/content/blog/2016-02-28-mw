<!-- Assume men and women are the same -->
<p>
	Men say, “Women can never make up their minds.”
</p><p>
	But actually both men and women are equally indecisive.
</p><p>
	Women say, “Men think one thing but say another.”
</p><p>
	But actually both men and women are equally indirect.
</p><p>
	We think the differences between our group and another group are greater than they are.
</p><p>
	But the differences <strong>among</strong> men, and the differences <strong>among</strong> women, are much bigger than the differences <strong>between</strong> men and women.
</p><p>
	So instead, <a href="/compensate">to compensate for your tendency to exaggerate those differences</a>, just assume men and women are the same.
</p><p>
	They’re not the same, but by using this rule, your thinking will be closer to correct than not.
