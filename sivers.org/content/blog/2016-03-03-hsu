<!-- Happy, Smart, and Useful -->
<img src="/images/hsu.gif">
<p>
	There are three things to consider when making life-size decisions:
</p><ul><li><strong>
	what makes you happy
</strong></li><li><strong>
	what’s smart (long-term good for you)
</strong></li><li><strong>
	what’s useful to others
</strong></li></ul><p>
	We have a tendency to forget one of these.
	For example:
</p><h2>
	smart and useful (not happy)
</h2><p>
	This is the stereotype of the strict parent that says:
</p><p>
	“You will go to the best school, get perfect grades, get a degree in law or medicine, and make lots of money. What you want does not matter. This is what’s best for you and your family.”
</p><p>
	Smart and useful isn’t bad.
	It’s rational, like a machine.
	But <strong>happiness is the oil</strong>.
	Without it, the friction kills the engine.
</p><h2>
	happy and smart (not useful)
</h2><p>
	This is the stereotype of the “lifestyle design” or self-help addict:
</p><p>
	Always learning, always improving, and obsessively focused on how to be happy and create the perfect life.
</p><p>
	They look for “passive income” instead of focusing on doing something that’s <a href="/starving-artist">really valuable to others</a>.
</p><p>
	Happy and smart isn’t bad.
	The self-focus feels great at first.
	But you can’t actually <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pull_oneself_up_by_one%27s_bootstraps">pull yourself up by your bootstraps</a>.
	Ultimately <strong>you must be lifted by those around you</strong>.
</p><h2>
	happy and useful (not smart)
</h2><p>
	This is the stereotype of the charity volunteers:
</p><p>
	After getting expensive university degrees, they spend years flying full-time to exotic impoverished places to dig wells and thatch roofs.
</p><p>
	But if a graduate’s time could be worth $200 per hour, yet they’re doing work that locals could do better for $10 per hour (and without airfare and hotels), then they’re actually doing a disservice to others.
	Read “<a href="http://lesswrong.com/lw/3gj/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/">Efficient Charity: Do Unto Others</a>” and “<a href="https://medium.com/the-development-set/the-reductive-seduction-of-other-people-s-problems-3c07b307732d">The Reductive Seduction of Other People’s Problems</a>” for more thoughts on that.
</p><p>
	In this same category are people who stay at the same job for life without improvement, and the musicians who always perform at the local venue but never make a good recording.
</p><p>
	Happy and useful isn’t bad.
	They’re doing good for the world, so it’s hard to find fault.
	But they’ve got <strong>great intentions but lame strategies</strong> — wasted effort and unused potential.
</p><h2>
	just happy (not smart or useful)
</h2><p>
	This is the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=mexican+fisherman+american+business">parable of the Mexican fisherman</a>.
</p><p>
	“Just be happy. That’s all that matters.”
	It sounds so simple, it must be profoundly true, right?
</p><p>
	But, like Aesop’s fable of “<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ant+grasshopper+fable">The Ant and the Grasshopper</a>”, you’ll be full of regret if you think of nothing but today, and don’t prepare for tough times.
</p><p>
	And you’ll be all kinds of unrewarded if you only serve yourself, not others.
</p><h2>
	So…?
</h2><p>
	I sound critical, but I’m writing this to myself as a reminder.
</p><p>
	When a life or plan feels ultimately unsatisfying, I find it’s because I’ve forgotten to include:
</p><ul><li>
	what makes me happy
</li><li>
	what’s smart (long-term good for me)
</li><li>
	what’s useful to others
</li></ul><p>
