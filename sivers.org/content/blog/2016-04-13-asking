<!-- Don’t start a business until people are asking you to -->
<p>
	When you bake a cake, you need to do first things first.
</p><p>
	You need to get the ingredients before you turn on the oven.
</p><p>
	You need to bake it before you frost it and slice it.
</p><p><strong>
	I meet a lot of people who want to start a business.
</strong></p><p>
	Some don’t have an idea yet.
	I don’t understand this.
	It’s like wanting to wear a bandage when you don’t have a wound.
</p><p>
	Most have an <strong>idea</strong> but no customers.
	For them I always say, “Don’t start a business until people are asking you to.”
</p><p>
	This is not meant to be discouraging.
	It just means you need to get the ingredients before you turn on the oven.
</p><p>
	First you find real people whose problem you can solve.
	You listen deeply to find their dream scenario.
	You make sure they’re happy to pay you enough.
</p><p>
	Don’t <a href="/zipit">announce</a> anything.
	Don’t choose a <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2003/06/naming_a_busine.html">name</a>.
	Don’t make a website.
	Don’t build a system.
<strong>
	You need to be free to completely change or ditch your idea.
</strong></p><p>
	Then you get your first <strong>paying</strong> customer.
	Provide a one-on-one personal service.
</p><p>
	Then you get another paying customer.
<strong>
	Prove a real demand.
</strong></p><p>
	Then, <strong><a href="/walkways">as late as possible</a></strong>, you officially start your business.
