<!-- How to get rich -->
<p>
	(part of <a href="/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h2>1.
	Live where luck strikes.
</h2><p>
	Live where everything is happening,
</p><p>
	where the money is flowing,
</p><p>
	where careers are being made,
</p><p>
	where your role models live.
</p><p>
	Once there, be as in the game as anyone can be.
</p><p>
	Be right in the <a href="/2014-02-baker">middle of everything</a>.
</p>

<h2>2.
	Say yes to everything.
</h2><p>
	Meet <a href="/hundreds">everyone</a>.
</p><p>
	Pursue every opportunity.
</p><p>
	Nothing is too small.
	Do it all.
</p><p>
	Like lottery tickets, you never know which one will win.
	So the more, the better.
</p><p>
	Follow-up and keep in touch with everyone.
</p>
	
<h2>3.
	Learn the multiplying skills.
</h2><p>
	Speaking, writing, psychology, design, conversation, 2nd language, persuasion, programming, meditation/focus.
</p><p>
	Not pursued on their own, they’re skills that <a href="/book/HowToFail">multiply</a> the success of your main pursuit.
</p><p>
	(A pilot who’s also a great writer and public speaker.)
</p><p>
	(A chef with a mastery of psychology, persuasion, and design.)
</p><p>
	These skills multiply the results of your efforts, and give you an edge over others in your field.
</p>

<h2>4.
	Pursue market value not personal value.
</h2><p>
	Do what pays well.
</p><p>
	Do not be the <a href="/starving-artist">starving artist</a>, working on things that have great <a href="/book/PersonalDevelopmentForSmartPeople">personal value</a> to you, but little <a href="/book/PredictablyIrrational">market value</a>.
</p><p>
	<a href="/book/SoGood">Follow the money</a>.
	It tells you where you’re most valuable.
</p><p>
	Don’t try to make a career out of everything you love.  For example, sex.
</p>

<h2>5.
	Shamelessly imitate success.
</h2><p>
	Imitate the best strategies of your competitors.
</p><p>
	The market doesn’t care about your personal need to be unique.
</p><p>
	It’s selfless and humble to use the best ideas regardless of source, to create the best service or product for your clients.
</p><p>
	Get great at executing other people’s ideas as well as your own.
</p>

<h2>6.
	Be the owner, not just inventor.
</h2><p>
	It’s tempting to try to be the ideas person, having someone else do the dirty work of making those ideas happen.
</p><p>
	Ideas don’t make you rich.
	Great execution of ideas does.
</p><p>
	A rule of capitalism: whoever takes the most financial risk gets the rewards.
</p><p>
	The biggest rewards will always go to those that fund it and own it.
</p><p>
	<a href="/book/HowToGetRich">To get rich</a>, be the owner.
	Own as close to 100% as possible.
</p>

<h2>7.
	Benefit from human nature.
</h2><p>
	Instead of complaining about the downside of human nature, find ways to benefit from it.
</p><p>
	Instead of complaining about the rules, just learn the game, then <a href="/book/MeInc">play it</a>.
