<p>
	(part of <a href="/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>

<h2>1.
	Change yes to “Hell yeah!” or no.
</h2><p>
	Once successful, you need to <a href="/switch">switch</a> strategies.
</p><p>
	To get successful, you had to say yes to everything.
</p><p>
	Now if you continue doing that, you’ll drown in all the opportunities.
</p><p>
	Now say no to anything that makes you say anything less than “<a href="/hellyeah">Hell yeah!</a>”
</p>

<h2>2.
	Keep momentum.
</h2><p>
	The temptation is to take it easy.
</p><p>
