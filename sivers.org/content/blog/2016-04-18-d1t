<!-- How to thrive in an unknowable future -->
<p>
	(part of <a href="/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h2>1.
	Prepare for the worst.
</h2><p>
	Since you have no idea what the future may bring, be open to the best and the worst.
</p><p>
	But the best case scenario doesn’t need your preparation or your attention.
</p><p>
	So mentally and financially prepare for the worst case, instead.
</p><p>
	Like insurance, don’t obsess on it.
	Just prepare, then carry on appreciating the good times.
</p>

<h2>2.
	Expect disaster.
</h2><p>
	Every biography of a successful person has that line, “And then, things took a turn for the worse.”
</p><p>
	Fully expect that disaster to come to you at any time.
</p><p>
	Completely assume it’s going to happen, and make your plans accordingly.
</p><p>
	Not just money, but health, family, freedom.
	<a href="/book/StoicJoy">Expect it all to disappear</a>.
</p><p>
	Besides, you appreciate things more when you know this may be your last time seeing them.
</p>

<h2>3.
	Own as little as possible. 
</h2><p>
	Depend on even less.
</p><p>
	The less you own, the less you’re affected by disaster.
</p>

<h2>4.
	Choose opportunity, not loyalty.
</h2><p>
	Have no loyalty to location, corporation, or your past public statements.
</p><p>
	Be an absolute <a href="/book/Antifragile">opportunist</a>, doing whatever is best for the future in the current situation, unbound by the past.
</p><p>
	Have loyalty for only your most important human relationships.
</p>

<h2>5.
	Choose the plan with the most options.
</h2><p>
	The best plan is the one that lets you change your plans.
</p><p>
	(Example: renting a house is buying the option to move at any time without losing money in a changing market.)
</p>

<h2>6.
	Avoid planning.
</h2><p>
	For maximum options, don’t plan at all.
</p><p>
	Since you have no idea how the situation or your mood may change in the future, wait until the last moment to make each decision.
