<!-- How to be useful to others -->
<p>
	(part of <a href="/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h2>1.
	Get famous.
</h2><p>
	Do everything in public and for the public.
</p><p>
	The more people you <a href="/book/ShowYourWork">reach</a>, the more useful you are.
</p><p>
	The opposite is hiding, which is of no use to anyone.
</p>

<h2>2.
	Get rich.
</h2><p>
	Money is neutral proof you’re adding value to people’s lives.
</p><p>
	So, by getting <a href="/book/HowToGetRich">rich</a>, you’re being useful as a side-effect.
</p><p>
	Once rich, spend the money in ways that are even more useful to others.
</p><p>
	Then getting rich is double-useful.
</p>

<h2>3.
	Share strong opinions.
</h2><p>
	Strong opinions are <a href="http://musicthoughts.com/t/99">very useful</a> to others.
</p><p>
	Those who were undecided or ambivalent can just adopt your stance.
</p><p>
	But those who disagree can solidify their stance by arguing against yours.
</p><p>
	Even if you invent an opinion for the sole sake of argument, boldly sharing a strong opinion is very useful to others.
</p>

<h2>4.
	Be expensive.
</h2><p>
	People given a placebo pill were twice as likely to have their pain disappear when told the pill was expensive.
</p><p>
	People who paid more for tickets were more likely to attend the performance.
</p><p>
	People who spend more for a product or service <a href="/aopv">value it more</a>, and get more use out of it.
