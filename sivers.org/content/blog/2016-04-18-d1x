<!-- How to stop being rich and happy -->
<p>
	(part of <a href="/d1">the “do this” directives</a>)
</p>
<h2>1.
	Prioritize lifestyle design.
</h2><p>
	You’ve made it, so it’s all about you, now.  Make your dreams come true.
</p><p>
	Shape your surroundings to please your every desire.
</p><p>
	Make your <a href="/book/TimeParadox">immediate gratification</a> the most important thing.
</p>

<h2>2.
	Chase that comparison moment.
</h2><p>
	You have the old thing. You want the new thing.
	Yes! Do it! Be happy for a week.
</p><p>
	Ignore the fact that the <a href="/book/StumblingOnHappiness">happiness only comes from the moment of comparison between the old and new</a>.
</p><p>
	Once you’ve had your new thing for a week, and it becomes the new norm, seek happiness from another new thing.
</p>

<h2>3.
	Buy, not rent.
</h2><p>
	Why rent a house, castle, boat, or car, when you can buy?
</p><p>
	It’s not about the thing, it’s about identity.
	This shows who you are now.
</p>

<h2>4.
	Internalize your new status.
</h2><p>
	You worked hard to get here.
	Celebrate. Relax.
</p><p>
	Admit you are in a different class of people now, with different needs.
</p><p>
	Understand there is no going back.
</p>

<h2>5.
	Be a connoisseur.
</h2><p>
	Learn what others say is the finest.
</p><p>
	Insist on only the finest.
</p><p>
	You will now be <a href="/book/StoicJoy">unhappy</a> with anything but the finest.
</p>

<h2>6.
	Get to know your possessions.
</h2><p>
	Now that you own the best, it’s time to focus on what you’ve got.
</p><p>
	Learn all about the features of your new possessions.
</p><p>
	Spend more time getting your surround sound and heated floor just right.
</p><p>
	Work out the solar panel charging of your Tesla car.
	This is important.
</p>

<h2>7.
	Acclimate to comfort.
</h2><p>
	Eliminate every discomfort from your life.
