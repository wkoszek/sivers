<!-- Singing the counter-melody -->
<p>
	A lot of people think my advice and opinions sound strange.
</p><p>
	Even my mom read a recent one and said, “You don’t actually mean this stuff, do you?”
</p><p>
	So, a little explanation:
</p><p>
	Do you know what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterpoint">musical counterpoint</a> is?
</p><p>
	Underneath the main melody, you have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=counter-melody">counter-melody</a> that goes against it, and together they make harmony.
</p><p>
	This is different than just harmonizing, where someone sings along with the melody at an interval.
	This is a separate melody that could stand on its own, but is really there to complement the main melody.
</p><p>
	Well, if my advice and opinions sound strange, it’s because <strong>I’m just the counter-melody</strong>.
</p><p>
	I know I’m not the only voice you hear.
	There’s a message I know that most of my readers or listeners are hearing, because it’s a common message we all hear these days.
	So let’s call that the melody.
</p><p>
	I may love that melody too, but I don’t want to just duplicate it.
	So I try to think of a good counter-melody.
</p><p>
	I do it to compensate (or <a href="/compensate">over-compensate</a>) for something I think is missing in the common message.
</p><p>
<strong>
	So my public posts are a counterpoint meant to complement the popular point.
</strong>
</p><p>
	For example:
</p><ul><li>
	There’s a glorification of leadership and those who start companies.
	So I suggested that <a href="/ff">it’s more effective to be an early follower</a>.
</li><li>
	The popular “law of attraction” says you should tell everyone your goals.
	So I shared an interesting study showing that <a href="/zipit">telling your plans makes them less likely to happen</a>.
</li><li>
	To people who are too focused on money, I preach my point that <a href="/a">generosity is a more effective path to success</a>.
</li><li>
	To people who are too focused on passion and purpose, I preach my point that money can lead you towards your purpose, because it shows you where you’re <a href="/starving-artist">valuable to others</a>.
</li><li>
	And I love pointing out that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different">the opposite of anything may also be true</a>.
</li></ul><p>
	Now if you ask me if I think the stuff I say is the only way to go, <strong>of course not!</strong>
	I’m just the counter-melody.
</p><p>
	My best advice is to listen to the <strong>combination</strong>.
	Eventually you’ll find yourself singing along with the melody you like best.
	Or making up your own.
