<!-- Possible futures -->
<p>
	I don’t know if you do this, or if it’s just me.
</p><p>
	I’ll get a big vision for my future.
	A huge project that would take many months or years.
	Something exciting and very worth doing.
</p><p>
	I’ll do a bunch of research, make a bunch of plans, and tell my friends all about it.
	They think I’ve made a big decision on a new direction in life.
</p><p>
	Then a month later, I have a completely different vision.
	Something unrelated to the previous one.
	Something I’m <em>more</em> excited about.
</p><p>
	And the process repeats.
</p><p><strong>
	I used to feel bad about this.
</strong>
	Like I should stop having new ideas for the future, and just stick with one.
	I used to feel bad for not doing them.
<strong>
	Then I made a little change that made a big difference:
</strong></p><p>
	I made a folder on my computer called “Possible Futures”.
</p><p>
	For each big plan, I make a new file in that folder, and put all of my ideas and research into it.
</p><p>
	Now I can daydream all I want, not feeling bad that I’m not taking immediate action on this idea, because now it’s clear that <strong>it’s just one of many possible futures.</strong>
</p><p>
	It also reminds me that <strong>I love daydreaming, just for its own sake.</strong>
</p><p>
	I’ve got 58 different futures in there as of today.
	A few times a year, I read through them all.
	Some seem stupid now, but some get more and more enticing with time.
</p><p>
	When I finish a big project, and I’m feeling ready for a new future, I open this folder and pick one to make real.
