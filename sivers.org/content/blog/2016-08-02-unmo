<!-- When you’re extremely un-motivated -->
<p>
	I’ve been feeling extremely un-motivated lately.
	I don’t know why.
</p><p>
	I look at things that excited me just a few months ago, and I think, “Why bother? What’s the point?”
	I don’t feel like doing anything.
</p><p>
	What do you do when you don’t want to do anything?
</p><p>
	Well, I also have a list of things that I should do, things that really need doing, but I <strong>never</strong> feel like it.
</p><p>
	<a href="http://plaintextaccounting.org/">Boring</a> things.
	<a href="http://www.gyst.com/">Necessary</a> things.
	Things I’ve been putting off for years, but really do need to get done.
	The reason I never do them is <strong>I’m always more excited about something else</strong>.
</p><p>
	Ah, but I’m not excited about <strong>anything</strong> now, am I?
</p><p>
	So now, when I’m <strong>not</strong> excited about anything else, is a perfect time to do them!
</p><p>
	So I made a list of these necessary things, and have been getting them all done.
	It’s not fun, but I use some caffeine, and get through it.
	It actually feels pretty good.
</p><p>
	Conventional wisdom tells us to <a href="http://eatthatfrogbook.com/eat-that-frog-what-does-it-mean/">do the important and difficult thing first</a>, but doing this boring work has moved me from a state of doing nothing to doing something.
	I’m just starting to feel like doing something important again.
</p><p>
	So next time you’re feeling extremely un-motivated, do those things you never want to do anyway.
