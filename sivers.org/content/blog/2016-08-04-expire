<!-- Keep earning your title, or it expires -->
<p>
	Until yesterday, I called myself an entrepreneur.
	Today I erased it from the top of every page on my site.
</p><p>
	It’s been years since I started a company, so I can’t keep using that title.
</p><p>
	Someone who played football in high school can’t call himself an athlete forever.
	Someone who did something successful long ago can’t keep calling himself a success.
</p><p><strong>
	You have to keep earning it.
</strong></p><p>
	Holding on to an old title gives you satisfaction without action.
	But success comes from doing, not declaring.
</p><p>
	By using a title without still doing the work, you fool yourself into thinking future success is assured.
	(“This is who I am!”)
	That <a href="/zipit">premature sense of satisfaction</a> can keep you from doing the hard work necessary.
</p><p>
	Stop fooling yourself.
	Be honest about what’s past and what’s present.
	Expiring old titles lets you admit what you’re really doing <a href="/now">now</a>.
</p><p>
	And if you don't like the idea of losing your title, then <strong>do</strong> something about it!
	This goes for titles like “good friend”, “leader”, or “risk-taker”, too.
</p><p>
	I updated my <a href="/">home page</a> to reflect what accomplishments are in the past.
	It’s liberating to speak in past-tense about what’s passed, and only speak in present-tense about what’s actually present.
</p><p>
	I do plan to start another company some day.
	And when I do, I will have earned the “entrepreneur” title again.
