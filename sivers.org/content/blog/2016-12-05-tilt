<!-- Tilting my mirror (motivation is delicate) -->
<p>
	Motivation is delicate.
</p><p>
	When you notice your motivation dying, you have to seek out the subtle cause.
</p><p>
	Then a <strong>simple tweak</strong> can make all the difference between achieving something or not.
</p><p>
	An hour outside my city, there’s a little mountain range.
	It’s gorgeous on the other side.
</p><p>
	But the road that crosses the mountains is very twisted, with sharp turns every few seconds.
	The first two times I drove across it, my kid threw up in the back seat.
</p><p>
	It’s also stressful.
	I’m surrounded by gorgeous mountain scenery, but I can’t take my eyes off the winding road.
</p><p>
	Though I drive at a normal speed, the other cars follow impatiently on my tail, because many of them drive this road every day.
</p><p>
	It’s only a half hour to cross, but I always arrive pretty drained.
	The stress was affecting my motivation enough that I wanted to stop visiting.
</p><p>
	So one day I tried a new approach.
<strong>
	I drove really slowly.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Now the turns didn’t make my kid sick.
	Now I could afford to take a few seconds to glance sideways and appreciate the scenery.
</p><p>
	Now it wasn’t stressful, except for one thing: <strong>the impatient queue of cars behind me.</strong>
	I care (perhaps too much) about other people, so just seeing them in my mirror made me go back to driving faster than I wanted, which brought back all the original problems.
</p><p>
	So I made one <strong>simple tweak:</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	I tilted my rear view mirror up towards the ceiling, so I couldn’t see anything behind me.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Ahhh... Instantly relaxed.
</p><p>
	Now it feels like I’m almost alone on this gorgeous mountain drive.
	Going at my own pace, not influenced or stressed by anyone else.
</p><p>
	There’s a passing lane every few minutes, so when it comes, the other cars whiz by me.
	For 30 minutes, they’re not my problem.
	When I get to the other side, I put my mirror back.
</p><p>
	Now I go visit all the time, no stress at all.
</p><hr><p>
<strong>
	You know I’m going for the metaphor here.
</strong>
</p><ul><li>
	social media comments
</li><li>
	distracting environments
</li><li>
	discouraging family
</li><li>
	your email inbox
</li></ul><p>
	Even the toughest of us have delicate motivations.
</p><p>
	When you notice something is affecting your drive, <strong>find a way to adjust your environment.</strong>
	Even if it’s a little inconvenient to others.
