<!-- How to do what you love and make good money -->
<h2>
	The problem:
</h2>
<p>
	People with a well-paying job ask my advice because they want to quit to become full-time artists.
</p><p>
	But full-time artists ask my advice because they’re finding it impossible to make money.
</p><p>
	(Let’s define “art” as anything you do for expression, even just blogging or whatever.)
</p>
<h2>
	The solution:
</h2>
<p>
	For both of them, I prescribe the lifestyle of <strong>the happiest people I know:</strong>
</p>
<ol><li><strong>
	Have a well-paying job
</strong></li><li><strong>
	Seriously pursue your art for love, not money
</strong></li></ol>
<h2>
	The ingredients:
</h2>
<h3>
	Balance:
</h3>
<p>
	You’ve heard about balancing heart and mind, or right-brain left-brain, or whatever you want to call it.
</p><p>
	We all have a need for stability and adventure, <a href="https://youtu.be/Cpc-t-Uwv1I?t=10m50s">certainty and uncertainty</a>, money and expression.
</p><p>
	Too much stability, and you get bored.
	Not enough, and you’re devastated.
	So keep the balance.
</p><p>
	Do something for love, and something for money.
	Don’t try to make one thing satisfy your entire life.
</p><p>
	In practice, then, <strong>each half of your life becomes a remedy for the other.</strong>
</p><p>
	You get paid and get stability for part of your day, but then need creative time for expression.
</p><p>
	So you push yourself creatively, expose your vulnerable darlings to the public, feel the frustration of rejection and apathy, and then long for some stability again.
</p><p>
	Each half a remedy for the other.
</p>
<h3>
	Job:
</h3>
<p>
	Be smart, and choose <a href="/images/jobwages.jpg">something that pays well with a solid future</a>.
</p><p>
	Look for statistics in your area about what pays the best, when factoring in training required.
</p><p>
	You’ll probably need to study for a few years to build up the rare skills that are well-rewarded.
</p><p>
	Read the book “<a href="/career">So Good They Can’t Ignore You</a>” for more great thoughts on this.
</p><p>
	<strong>This is a head choice, not heart choice,</strong> since you’re not trying to make your job your entire life.
</p>
<h3>
	Art:
</h3>
<p>
	Pursue it seriously.
	Take lessons.
	Make weekly progress.
	Keep improving, even if you’ve been doing it for decades.
</p><p>
	If you don’t progress and challenge yourself creatively, it won’t satisfy the balance.
</p><p>
	Release and sell your work, like a pro.
	Find some fans.
<a href="/ppay">
	Let them pay you.
</a>
	Make a band and do some gigs for fun.
</p><p>
	But the attitude is different than someone who needs the money.
</p><p>
	You don’t need to worry if it doesn’t sell.
	You don’t need to please the marketplace.
	No need to compromise your art, or value it based on others’ opinions.
</p><p>
<strong>
	You’re just doing this for yourself — art for its own sake.
</strong>
</p><p>
	And you’re releasing it because that’s one of the most rewarding parts, is important for self-identity, and gives you good feedback on how to improve.
</p>
<h3>
	Self-control:
</h3>
<p>
<strong>
	Your main obstacle to this amazing life will be self-control.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Mind management, to leave your job at the office, and not bring it home with you.
</p><p>
	Time management, to stop addictions like social media and video-watching, and make your art your main relaxing activity.
</p><p>
	Read the book “<a href="/book/DailyRituals">Daily Rituals</a>” for great examples of this.
</p>
<h2>
	Final thoughts:
</h2>
<p>
	How nice to not expect your job to fulfill all your emotional needs.
</p><p>
	How nice to not taint something you love with the need to make money from it.
</p><p>
	Most full-time artists I know only spend an hour or two a day actually doing their art.
	The rest is spent on mundane crap that comes with trying to make it a full-time career.
	So skip the art career and just do the art.
</p><p>
	I’m fully expecting you to disagree with this advice.
	But I’ve met about a hundred people a week for the last 18 years, many of them full-time musicians, many of them not, but <strong>the happiest people I know</strong> are the ones that have this balance.
	So there’s my blunt template advice, given only because people keep asking.
</p><p>
<strong>
	Don’t try to make your job your whole life.
</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>
	Don’t try to make your art your sole income.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Let each be what it is, and put in the extra effort to balance the two, for a rewarding life.
