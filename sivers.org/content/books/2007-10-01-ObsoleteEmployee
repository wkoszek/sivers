TITLE: The Obsolete Employee - by Michael Russer
ISBN: 0966248465
RATING: 3
SUMMARY: How to run a company without employees, but with a loose network of work-from-home freelance agents. Very instructive, but also good perspective like how until the industrial revolution, there were no employees: everyone was freelance.
NOTES: 
Business owners will always have issues with their support staff as long as they don't feel truly fulfilled by their work, no matter what perks the employer gives them.

You (the business owner) are working for the person (employee) who asks, "What can you do for me today?"

A team full of people resenting the team leader is no team at all.

Have formal written business processes for every signifiant job function.  Outsource it to a consultant who specializes in creating and maintaining written business processes.

Talent on demand rather than having to pay for employees all the time, whether you need them or not.

You are hiring an independent contractor who is an expert at what they do (rather than a jack of all trades).

Make sure you hire specialists and avoid those that offer many different types of services.

Virtual Support Organizations (VSO) provide ongoing support like an employee, but from a distance.

Financial management : use online accounting systems (quickbooks.com) so a virtual CFO can remotely manage and keep me up-to-date on every aspect of my company's financial health.

Precisely spell out what you want done, how it is to be done, and the desired measurable outcome once it is done.

Know what kinds of special skills or experience are required to do the job most effectively.

------------------------------


------------------------------ AFTER PHONE:
Now that you've had an opportunity to review the support processes we need to have done, what other clarifications or specifics about it can I provide you?

Do you have any suggestions for completing what we need done in a more effective manner than the way it was described?

Are you anticipating any initial setup before you can start?  If so, what will it entail and how much will it cost?

Why do you require a retainer?  What happpens to the unused balance at the end of each month?

Why are you excited about taking on my company as a client?

What is the range of hours during the day I can contact you?

Are there any restrictions as to when or how I can contact you in the event of an emergency?

How often do you invoice and what "net" terms do you typically require?

Do you have any concerns or objections if we use my own Indepdent Contractor's Agreement for our working relationship?

How soon can you start?
------------------------------------------------


DO
- value the relationship
- see your VA as an equal partner
- articulate your needs and wants well
- maintain a trusting relationship
- stay centered, focused, and organized so as not to distract your VA

DON'T
- fail to communicate when they request something from you
- attempt to micromanage
- treat your VA like a low-level employee
- live in the urgent, where everything is last-minute



Do not make the mistake of dumping more and broader scope of work on them, as time goes on.

Important to have a written business process for each support function a VA does for you.  This discipline will quickly disappear into a mist of good intentions as soon as you try to broaden the scope of your VAs.

COO : Must have extensive experience assisting businesses from the strategic, operational, and HR perspectives.

Start with the small steps of hiring VAs for specific, measurable tasks.  After you have two or more working with you and everything is going smoothly, consider hiring an executive level VA to grow your virtual team beyond that point.

If your VA team interacts with your prospects, customers, or suppliers, have them use your email signature (with their name not yours).
