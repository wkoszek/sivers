	This is the permanent URL I use to post whenever I’m hiring.

	Last month I was hiring a president. Last week I was hiring an illustrator.

	As of now, though, I’m not taking any more applications.  So sorry if you’re seeing this too late.

	If you <a href="/list">get on my private email list</a>, you’ll hear of any new opportunities first.
