Open database of contacts with ratings. REST interface so it can be integrated into other internal software.
</p><p>
For example, <a href="/muckwork">Muckwork</a> will be constantly finding companies for people: a photographer in Berlin, a rehearsal studio in Chicago.  Instead of keeping those findings locked in a private database, it would be better to open them up to the world, and let other people suggest companies they've used and like, or give ratings for which companies to avoid.  So Muckwork will actually use it as its sole database of contacts.
</p><p>
Usually databases like this are locked down and sold, or traffic is encouraged to stay on the site for advertising, but Karmalist will be kept wide open with no standalone business motive, and encourage embedding into other software.
