<h2>
	Short explanation:
</h2><p><strong>
	Answering people’s questions was taking up all of my time.
	<a href="/quit">So I quit</a>.
</strong></p><p>
	Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a> to introduce yourself, share your thoughts, or anything else.
	I happily read and reply to every email.
	But if you ask me a question, unfortunately I can’t answer.

<h2>
	Long explanation:
</h2><p>
	You’d think it would be easy to answer <strong>a quick 5-minute question</strong>, right?
	But I get almost 100 a day, so that’s 500 minutes, which is about 8 hours.
</p><p>
	In 2016, I answered 30,904 emails from 11,971 people.
	Since 2008, I’ve answered over 192,000 emails from 78,000 people.
</p><p><strong>
	Answering people’s questions had become my full-time job.
</strong>
	This approach was unsustainable.
</p><p>
	So <strong>my original plan was to become completely unreachable after 2016!</strong>
	I was going to go hard-core, shut off all email and social media, and make myself unreachable to all but a few close friends and colleagues.
	It felt like the only solution.
</p><p>
	But then I realized <strong>I could remain reachable as long as I don’t answer questions</strong>.
	(This is like <a href="/tilt">tilting my mirror</a>.)
</p><p>
	It only takes a few minutes a day to read my emails, and say thanks.
	What was taking forever were my answers!
</p><p>
	So, I’m <strong>sincerely sorry</strong> if you took the time to send me a question, and I sent you here.
	It feels weird to not answer.
	I hope you understand why I can’t.
	I need to <a href="/projects">finish my projects</a> instead.
</p><p>
	Lastly, please see <strong><a href="/contact">why you should still contact me</a> anyway.</strong>

	As a musician, I would often do shows where I would perform for two hours, playing every single song I knew.
</p><p>
	People would come up to me to make a request.
	I’d have to say, “Sorry, I’m playing you everything I know.”
</p><p>
	This website is like my show.
