I’m home in Wellington, New Zealand. It’s summer.
</p><p>
After <a href="/na">reducing my obligations</a>, I’m extra-focused on some stuff I’ve been meaning to do for a long time:
</p><ul><li>
recording audio of me reading all my articles (yes I’m finally going to have a podcast, though more like an ongoing audiobook)
</li><li>
doing the music for those, too (each one a little different)
</li><li>
learning Esperanto (<a href="http://www.fluentin3months.com/2-weeks-of-esperanto/">see why, here</a>) using <a href="http://lernu.net/en">lernu</a> and <a href="https://www.italki.com/teachers/esperanto">italki</a>. I’m so into it! What a cool language! So simple and well-designed. (Good overview <a href="http://lernu.net/en/esperanto">here</a>.)
</li><li>
taking weekly Esperanto lessons by phone with <a href="https://frenchlover.org/about-angel/">Angel</a>
</li><li>
Making music for the first time in 20 years! Learning my new music tools: <a href="https://www.steinberg.net/en/products/cubase/start.html">Cubase 9</a>, <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/keyboards/komplete-kontrol-s-series/">Komplete Kontrol S88</a> and <a href="https://www.native-instruments.com/en/products/komplete/bundles/komplete-11-ultimate/">Komplete 11 Ultimate</a>
</li><li>
taking Cubase lessons by phone with <a href="https://knobtheory.com/private-lessons/">Knob Theory</a>
</li><li>
editing <a href="/book">all my book notes</a> into a new format so every single idea can be fed into the database separately and tagged with keywords for future browsing
</li><li>
editing <a href="/m">my book for musicians</a>
</li><li>
compiling the last few years of blog posts into a book called “Unlearning”
</li></ul><p>
I’m so excited about all of these! That’s a great feeling.
</p><p>
After that, I’ll get back to programming <a href="/projects">some new things</a>, and regular new writing.
