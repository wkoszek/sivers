First, read “<a href="/song-contest-idea">A free, open song contest idea</a>.”
</p><p>
The big idea is that this songwriting contest will mostly run itself, on a monthly loop.
</p><p>
A manager's role is only to contact companies to ask if they want to donate prizes for the winners, in return for the exposure of having the musicians pore over the list of prizes, with links back to the company's site for more info. (The power of drool.)
</p><p>
A little admin work to enter the prize info, make sure the winner gets it, and oversee the system to make sure it's not being gamed in some surprising way.
</p><p>
And voilá!  Free song contest.

<h3>Status: maybe some day</h3>
