For the TED Conference, you can submit a few different ideas for a talk you'd like to do.
For this TED, I submitted three ideas.
Two I was excited about, and one as an afterthought.
Of course they chose the afterthought: this talk.
</p><p>
I'm really no expert in this subject.
I had just read an interesting article in Newsweek Magazine about this, then did a little sleuthing to find the original research, then presented what I'd found.
Total time spent: maybe 5 hours.
See the original article, full of links to more information, <a href="/zipit">here</a>.

Since people on the TED stage are usually experts, people have taken this talk far too seriously.
It was really meant as just a 2-minute eyebrow-raiser.
A little something to think about.
That's all.
But over 400 comments arguing about it on <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself">the TED page for it</a>.
</p><p>
But I wish I would have included one important point, that makes a lot of difference:
</p><p>
These studies are only about <strong>identity goals</strong>: goals usually related to personal development, that would make you a slightly different person if completed.
</p><p>
This does NOT apply to things like starting a company, brainstorming, or other pursuits where it would be useful to corral a bunch of people to support your project.
