<!-- SUBTITLE: 9 short stories to a TEDx crowd at the National University of Singapore. -->
<!-- MINUTES: 22 -->
<p>
I was asked at the last minute to speak at a TEDx conference the National University of Singapore.
I didn't have time to prepare a big 20-minute talk, so I shared nine of my best little 2-minute stories.

Explanation of the opening minute:
The two talks right before me were about evolution and insect penises.
I couldn't resist a punchline. â˜º
