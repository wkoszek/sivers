<!-- TITLE: Next Bank Asia : Disrupting Banking -->
<!-- SUBTITLE: Addressing a room of bankers in Singapore about eliminating friction and serving tech entrepreneurs. -->
<!-- MINUTES: 16 -->
<p>
I was surprised when I was asked to speak at a banking conference, but they said they wanted it to be disruptive and untraditional, so I said yes.
I've felt so much frustration with banks, that I thought this a fine time to vent.
</p><p>
Main points:
</p><ul>
<li>The biggest bank in 20 years will be one that doesn't exist now.</li>
<li>Disruption starts by serving the low-end market</li>
<li>Internet entrepreneurs are the low-end market for banks</li>
<li>Banking is the bottleneck of entrepreneurship</li>
<li>Singapore is the place this disruption could/should happen</li>
<li>To protect your business, be paranoid. To advance, be fearless.</li>
</ul>
