<h1>Make a dream come true</h1>

<p>
	Selling my friends’ CDs was starting to take up a lot of my time.
	I realized I had accidentally started a business.
	But I didn’t want to start a business!
	I was already living my dream life as a fulltime musician.
	I didn’t want anything to distract me from that.
</p><p>
	So, I thought that by taking an unrealistically utopian approach, I could keep the business from growing too much.
	Instead of trying to make it big, I was going to make it small.
	It was the opposite of ambition, so I had to think in a way that was the opposite of ambitious.
</p><p>
	I wrote down my utopian dream-come-true distribution deal from my musician’s point of view.
	In a perfect world, my distributor would...
</p><ol><li>
	Pay me every week.
</li><li>
	Show me the full name and address of everyone who bought my CD.
	(Because those are my fans, not the distributor’s.)
</li><li>
	Never kick me out for not selling enough.
	(Even if I sell only one CD every five years, it’ll be there for someone to buy.)
</li><li>
	Never allow paid placement.
	(Because it’s not fair to those who can’t afford it.)
</li></ol><p>
	That’s it!
	That was my mission.
	I liked it.
	It was a worthy hobby.
	I named it CD Baby, and put my friends’ CDs there.
</p><p>
	Those four points were like a mission statement.
	I wrote them on the site, talked about them at every conference, and made sure everyone I worked with knew them.
</p><p>
	The key point is that I wasn’t trying to make a big business.
	I was just daydreaming about how one little thing would look in a perfect world.
</p><p>
	When you make a business, you get to make a little universe where you control all the laws.
	This is your utopia.
</p><p>
	When you make it a dream come true for yourself, it’ll be a dream come true for someone else, too.
