Entity vs Incremental theories of intelligence: (by Carol Dweck)<br>
Entity theorists think "I am smart at this" and attribute success or failure to ingrained and unalterable level of ability. They see it as a fixed entity that cannot evolve.<br>
Incremental theorists thnk "I got it because I worked very hard at it" or "I should have tried harder". With hard work, difficult material can be grasped, step by step, incrementally, the novice can become the master.<br>
When challenged, incremental theorists are far more likely to rise to the level of the game, while entity theorists are brittle and quit.<br>
Children who associate success with hard work tend to have a "mastery-oriented response" to challenging situations.<br>
<br>
The key to pursuing excellence is to embrace an organic long-term learning process, and not live in a shell of static safe mediocrity.<br>
Growth comes at the expense of previous comfort or safety.<br>
Like a hermit crab, when you outgrow your shell, you need to be vulnerable while you find a new shell.<br>
Someone stuck in entity mindset is like an anorexic hermit crab, starving itself so it doesn't grow to have to find a new shell.<br>
<br>
Many people take a process-first philosophy and transform it into an excuse for never putting themselves on the line or pretending not to care about results.<br>
They claim to be egoless, to care only about learning, but really this is an excuse to avoid confronting themselves.<br>
Short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy.<br>
Too much sheltering from results can be stunting.<br>
<br>
We have to take responsibilty for ourselves and nurture a healthy liberated mind-set.<br>
We need to put ourselves out there, give it our all, and reap the lesson, win or lose.<br>
There will be nothing learned from any challenge in which we don't try our hardest.<br>
Growth comes at the point of resistance.<br>
We learn by pushing ourselves and finding what really lies at the outer reaches of our abilities.<br>
<br>
The importance of regaining presence and clarity of mind after making a serious error.<br>
The first mistake rarely proves disastrous, but the downward spiral of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th error creates a devastating chain reaction.<br>
<br>
If a student of any discipline could avoid ever repeating the same mistake twice, they would skyrocket to the top of their field.<br>
Of course this is impossible - we are bound to repeat thematic errors if only because many themes are elusive and difficult to pinpoint.<br>
Minimize repetition as much as possible by having an eye for consistent psychological and technical themes of error.<br>
<br>
It's essential to have a liberating incremental approach that allows for times when you are not in a peak performance state.<br>
We must take responsibilty for ourselves and not expect the rest of the world to understand what it takes to become the best that we can become.<br>
Great ones are willing to get burned again and again while they sharpen their swords in the fire.<br>
<br>
Making smaller circles:<br>
Those who succeed have slightly more honed skills than the rest.<br>
It's rarely a mysterious technique that drives us to the top, but rather a profound mastery of what may well be a basic skill set.<br>
Depth beats breadth, because it opens a channel for the intangible, unconscious, creative components of our hidden potential.<br>
<br>
Intuition is our most valuable compass in this world.<br>
It is the bridge between the unconscious and the concscious mind, and it is hugely important to keep in touch with what makes it tick.<br>
It's open communication with the wellspring of our creativity.<br>
<br>
My vision of the road to mastery:<br>
- start with the fundamentals<br>
- get a solid foundation fueled by the understanding of the principles of your discipline<br>
- expand and refine your repertoire, guided by your individual predispositions<br>
- while keeping in touch, however abstractly, with what you feel to be the essential core of the art<br>
What results is a network of deeply internalized, interconnected knowledge that expands from a central, personal locus point.<br>
<br>
When everyone at a high level has a huge amount of (technical) understanding, much of what separates the great from the very good is deep presence, relaxation of the conscious mind, which allows the unconscious to flow unhindered.<br>
This is a nuanced and misunderstood state of mind that when refined involves a subtle reintegration of the conscious mind into a free-flowing unconscious process.<br>
The idea is to shift the primary role from the conscious to the unconscious without blissing out and losing the precision the conscious can provide.<br>
Compare to putting your attention to your peripheral vision while reading a book, then putting your attention back on the book without losing the peripheral.<br>
<br>
In every discipline, the ability to be clearheaded, present, cool under fire is much of what separates the best from the mediocre.<br>
If one player is serenely present while the other is being ripped apart by internal issues, the outcome is already clear.<br>
The prey is no longer objective, makes compounding mistakes, and the predator moves in for the kill.<br>
This issue is even more critical in solitary pursuits such as writing, painting, thinking, or learning.<br>
In the absence of continual external reinforcement, we must be our own monitor, and quality of presence is often the best gauge.<br>
We cannot expect to touch excellence if "going through the motions" is the norm of our lives.<br>
If deep, fluid presence becomes second nature, then life, art, and learning take on a richness that will continually surprise and delight.<br>
Those who excel are those who maximize each moment's creative potential - for these masters of living, presence to the day-to-day learning process is akin to that purity of focus others dream of achieving in rare climactic moments when everything is on the line.<br>
The secret is that everything is always on the line.<br>
If we have any hope of attaining excellence, let alone of showing what we've got under pressure, we have to be prepared by a lifestyle of reinforcement.<br>
Presence must be like breathing.<br>
<br>
Practice the ebb and flow of stress and recovery.<br>
Instead of working until you are exhausted, push yourself to a healthy limit, then recover for a minute or two, and push yourself again.<br>
Create a rhythm of intervals.  With practice, increase the intensity and duration of your sprint time, and gradually condense rest periods.<br>
<br>
When Garry Kasparov handled his occasional lack of confidence by playing the chess moves that he would have played if he were feeling confident.<br>
He would pretend to feel confident, and hopefully trigger the state.<br>
Step by step, Garry would feed off his own chess moves, until soon enough the confidence would become real and Garry would be in the flow.<br>
In one way of looking at it, Garry was not pretending.  He was not being artificial.  He was triggering his zone by playing Kasparov chess.<br>
<br>
All of the learning principles discussed in this book spring out of the deep, creative plunge into an initially small pool of information.<br>
Study positions of reduced complexity.<br>
Apply internalized principles to increasingly complex scenarios.<br>
Take a single technique or idea and practice it until we feel its essence.<br>
Gradually condense the movements while maintaining their power, until we are left with an extremely potent and nearly invisible arsenal.<br>
Focus on a select group of techniques and internalize them until the mind perceives them in tremendous detail.<br>
<br>
Once we have felt the profound refinement of a skill, no matter how small it may be, we can then use that feeling as a beacon of quality as we expand our focus onto more and more material.<br>
Once you know what "good" feels like, you can zero in on it, search it out regardless of the pursuit.<br>
