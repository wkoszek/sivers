<h2>my notes</h2>
<p id="booknotes">
Whether you're writing a report, a letter, or a presentation, ask yourself:<br>
- Who's the audience?<br>
- What are they looking for?<br>
- How much detail do they want or need?<br>
- How will the information I have help them in going forward?<br>
- How much background information do they need?<br>
- Is anyone likely to be hostile toward what I have to say?<br>
- Are they familiar with industry jargons?<br>
- What kinds of examples and analogies will be most helpful to them?<br>
<br>
You can't cut to the chase unless you know to whom you are talking.<br>
<br>
Use momentum to keep major projects on course:<br>
- Make momentum part of the plan. Don't move ahead until everyone knows how to create momentum.<br>
- Grab low-hanging fruit. Select a few major "wins" and tackle them before doing anything else.<br>
- Go for just one big win. One important thing, and really deliver on it.<br>
- Celebrate early successes publicly. Celebrate. Congratulate everyone. Give updates and praise people involved.<br>
<br>
Which ad would catch your attention?  "Loaded with fiber and vitamins" or "will lower your blood pressure, cholesterol level, and help prevent a stroke"?<br>
Don't just tell people the benefits - show them how it will benefit their lives.<br>
BAD: "This car has antilock brakes and passenger-side airbag." GOOD: "This car will save your life."<br>
BAD: "We will prepare your taxes and send them to you, ready to sign."  GOOD: "Our customer's tax refunds are 25% higher than the average."<br>
BAD: "You will be working on a cross-departmental team." GOOD: "You'll be increasing your visibility in the company and working with people who can jump-start your career."<br>
BAD: "This speaker specializes in leadership." GOOD: "The last guy who hired this speaker said, 'He made me look like a hero and inspired my people to raise our profits by 80%.'"<br>
<br>
CLOSE THE LOOP:<br>
If your doctor says, "We'll call you if there's a problem" - and there's no call 2 weeks later, you're still wondering.<br>
When people don't close the loop, they leave the other person hanging.  It's not only distracting, but subtly erodes the relationship.<br>
Never let yourself be known as someone who leaves other people hanging. Once that label is applied, it's hard to shake.<br>
Consistently close the loop, and build a reputation as a dependable professional.<br>
<br>
BEAT CHANGE TO THE PUNCH:<br>
Carl Jung: "If there's a fear of falling, the only safety is deliberately jumping."<br>
Scan trade publications and talk with peers to discover new technologies, business practices, or processes that might help you do your job better.<br>
<br>
Before you ask anyone else to be involved, ask, "Do I really need this person's time? Can I do it on my own?"<br>
If you need the other person, define specifically what you need.  Explain why their involvement is important.<br>
Give them everything they need to get up to speed.  People don't mind giving their time if they feel it's valued and helpful.<br>
It's your reponsibility to have thought that through before you approach them.<br>
<br>
IF YOU WANT SOMETHING, ASK FOR IT<br>
Don't beat around the bush. Don't assume people will know what you need. Don't make them guess.<br>
The more specific you are about what you need, the faster you'll get it.<br>
If asking an employee or peer, clearly frame your request and set a deadline.<br>
<br>
MAKE SURE EVERYONE HAS THE MAP<br>
As if you're driving to the same destination in different cars, if everyone has the map, you don't need to wait for the slowest one.<br>
The it doesn't matter if you get separated, you all end up in the same destination.<br>
<br>
TELL THEM WHAT'S ON THE TEST<br>
Tell people how they will be measured, so they can focus on the most important things.<br>
To reinforce performance, link a portion of the compensation to their performance in those areas.<br>
<br>
CUT THE BULL<br>
Too many business conversations go nowhere because one person is afraid of offending the other.<br>
Say what you mean. Don't sugar-coat it. Make your point clearly and assertively, without being aggressive.<br>
Indirectness erodes trust and can cloud the issue.  It wastes time and can hurt your career.<br>
When you've got something to say, say it and move on.  Even if people don't agree with you, they'll respect you for your honesty and candor.<br>
<br>
EVERY CONVERSATION SHOULD HAVE A PURPOSE<br>
Business calls and lunches drag on long after the goal has been met. Informal meetings get sidetracked and nothing gets accomplished.<br>
Why? They failed to prepare as they would for any other meeting.  Ask yourself these 4 questions well in advance of call, talk, or lunch:<br>
- What do I want to accomplish?<br>
- What do I need from the other person?<br>
- What information do I want to share with this person?<br>
- What can I do to add value for this person?<br>
One exception : if the purpose of meeting is to build a relationship, don't formally state your objective.  However, make sure you've shared or learned everything you'd hoped to by meeting's end.<br>
<br>
SNAP OUT OF YOUR RUT IF...<br>
- You've grown extremely comfortable in your current role, succeeding easily without exerting yourself.<br>
- Everyone comes to you for answers, and you stop learning new things yourself.<br>
- You're happy, but waiting for something to truly test your resolve. (That something won't present itself. You need to go find it.)<br>
- Your success is overly dependent on one relationship.<br>
<br>
GOOD ENOUGH<br>
Don't let unhealthy perfectionism keep you from cutting to the chase.  Know when to let things go.<br>
Will anyone but me appreciate my efforts? <br>
Can I significantly improve this if I keep working?<br>
Does the possible gain in quality outweigh the lost time?<br>
<br>
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE TWICE<br>
If you're making a lot of different mistakes, you're learning.<br>
If you're making the same mistakes more than once, you're wasting time.<br>
