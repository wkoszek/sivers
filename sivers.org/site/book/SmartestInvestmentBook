<h2>my notes</h2>
<p id="booknotes">
DEFINTIONS:<br>
"Smart" Investing = investing for market returns by investing in all the stocks and bonds in broad market indexes.<br>
"Hyperactive" Investing = trying to beat the market by picking winners and timing the market.  (aka "Dumb")<br>
<br>
Investing for market returns is easier than investing hyperactively because:<br>
- you don't have to pay any attention to the financial media<br>
- you don't have to sift through mountains of conflicting information from self-styled experts<br>
- it's less expensive<br>
- the results are demonstrably superior<br>
- most investors do not need any advisor or broker : you can deal directly with brand-name mutual fund families<br>
- it should only take you 90 minutes or so per year<br>
<br>
There is ample data indicating that, over the long term, simply achieving market returns will beat 95% of all professionally managed investment portfolios.<br>
<br>
A majority of the volume of trading in the U.S. are just index ("smart") investing.<br>
<br>
FOUR VANGUARD MODEL PORTFOLIOS:  (1970-2004)<br>
Worst Single Calendar Year Loss, Average Annual Return<br>
LOW RISK = 3% loss, 8% gain<br>
MEDIUM-LOW RISK = 7% loss, 9% gain<br>
MEDIUM-HIGH RISK = 13% loss, 10% gain<br>
HIGH RISK = 18% loss, 11% gain<br>
<br>
Hold investments in a group of funds that, in turn, have investments in all the securities (stocks or bonds) in a particular index - that represent three broad indexes.<br>
#1 = An index fund representative of the US stock market in its broadest terms.  (Fidelity: FSTMX, Vanguard: VTSMX, Schwab: SWTSX)<br>
#2 = An index fund representative of the international stock market in its broadest terms. (Fidelity FSIIX, Vanguard: VGTSX, Schwab: SWISX)<br>
#3 = An index fund representative of the US bond market in its broadest terms.  (Fidelity: FBIDX,  Vanguard: VBMFX, Schwab: SWLBX)<br>
<br>
ASSET ALLOCATION:<br>
LOW RISK = 14% stocks, 6% int'l stocks, 80% bonds<br>
MEDIUM-LOW RISK = 28% stocks, 12% int'l stocks, 60% bonds<br>
MEDIUM-HIGH RISK = 42% stocks, 18% int'l stocks, 40% bonds<br>
HIGH RISK = 56% stocks, 24% int'l stocks, 20% bonds<br>
(NOTE: all stock-holdings are 70% domestic, 30% international.  Only choice is how much are stocks and how much are bonds.)<br>
<br>
Asset allocation accounts for 90% or more of the expected return from any particular portfolio.  The specific securities held only account for 5%.  Market timing accounts for 2%.<br>
Your cash requirements should amount to 6-12 months of living expenses.<br>
http://www.smartestinvestmentbook.com/ has interactive asset-allocation wizard.<br>
<br>
############## THE FOUR-STEP PROCESS #################<br>
<br>
1. Decide on your asset allocation (low, medium-low, medium-high, or high)<br>
2. Open an account with Fidelity, Vanguard, or similar passive deep-discount index<br>
3. Invest as described in your asset allocation plan<br>
4. Rebalance your portfolio twice a year to keep your portfolio either aligned with your original asset allocation or to a new asset allocation that meets your changed investment objectives or risk tolerance.<br>
<br>
###############################<br>
<br>
CHOOSING ACCOUNT (if not Fidelity):<br>
Very few fund families have a single stock market index fund that spans the entire U.S. stock market.<br>
Many fund families have an S&P 500, but that doesn't include the necessary small stocks.<br>
So you could find one that has both S&P 500 and a small stock index fund.<br>
If so, do 60% of stocks in S&P 500, 10% in small stock index fund, 30% in international.<br>
<br>
New and increasingly popular option is ETF, Exchange-Traded Fund, designed to replicate returns of a particular index.  Because they trade on exchange, they can be traded at any time.  Fees are very low, which makes them a reasonable alternative to index funds.  But they incur commissions like stocks, each time you trade.  As a practical matter, it doesn't make a difference whether you use ETFs or index mutual funds.<br>
If doing ETF, easiest way is to do "iShares" from barclays.com.  70% of stocks in iShares Russell 3000 Index (IWV), 30% of stocks in iShares MSCI EAFE (EFA), 100% of bonds in iShares Lehman Aggregate (AGG)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
FINANCIAL PORNOGRAPHY:<br>
In November 2000, Fortune magazine released the "top picks" from its panelists of "top" stock analysts.  Between November 2000 and November 2003, here's how those predictions fared:<br>
S&P 500 =       -22%<br>
NASDAQ =        -41%<br>
Fortune Picks = -80%<br>
<br>
In August 1979, Business Week featured a story called "The Death of Equities", saying it's a near-permanent position.  Almost immediately after publication, stocks began one of the great bull markets in history.<br>
<br>
Smart investors pay no attention to the predictions made in the financial media, and never use them as a basis for their investment decisions.<br>
<br>
---------=========---------<br>
<br>
WHEN DO SMART INVESTORS NEED AN ADVISOR?<br>
<br>
For larger investors with over $1M, some investment advisors can add value by adding a layer of complexity and fine-tuning to the asset allocation strategies named here.<br>
<br>
Fine-tuning for market returns usually adds some measure of extra benefit, without taking on extra risk, but it comes at a price : the management fee charged by an investment advisor.<br>
<br>
Some add real value by putting together relatively complex portfolios  that seek a premium over market returns by using a fund family called Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA) http://www.dfaus.com<br>
(NOTE: Dan Solin, the author, is a registered advisor and uses DFA funds for his clients.)  DFA manages more than $100 billion for large institutional and individual investors.<br>
It does not engage in market timing or stock picking.  All of its funds are passively managed, using a variant of index funds.  DFA makes its funds available through selected fee-based advisors, listed on their site.<br>
Be wary of any advisor who does not consider the lowest-cost options to implementing investment portfolios, including Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Fidelity/Vanguard index funds, low-cost index funds, or the entire lineup of passively managed DFA mutual funds.<br>
<br>
DFA and its network of consultants offer passive portfolios that are slightly different than ETFs and typical Fidelity index funds.<br>
These differences are due to the way in which stocks are assigned to indexes, by their real size (for example) without waiting for market index reconstitution.<br>
DFA also offers funds that concentrate on more precisely defined sectors, like more flavors of ice cream. (Versus Fidelity's vanilla, chocolate, strawberry.)<br>
For example : Fidelity doesn't offer index funds in the international small-cap or international value markets.<br>
<br>
There is strong academic evidence that tilting a portfolio optimially toward value and small-cap equities will, over long holding periods, outperform the broader equity markets by as much as 1-2% per year.<br>
But I do not believe this is worth it for investors with less than $1M to invest, when you consider the cost of advisors' fees.<br>
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>
<br>
#1 greatest threat to your financial well-being is the hyperactive broker or advisor.<br>
<br>
#2 greatest threat to your financial well-being is the false belief that you can trade on your own and attempt to beat the markets by engaging in stock picking or market timing.<br>
<br>
It is reasonable to expect your portfolio to achieve annualized returns from 7-11% over the long term.  Attempting to achieve returns higher than 11% involves speculating.<br>
<br>
If you choose one of the portfolios described here, you are likely to beat the returns of 95% of actively managed mutual funds over the long term.<br>
