<h2>
	Projecting meaning into Chinese characters
</h2>
<p>
	Chinese characters look complicated, but they’re mostly made up of smaller simpler characters.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="bigger">语</span>
	language = words 讠+ five 五+ mouth 口
</li>
<li>
<span class="bigger">谢</span>
	thanks = words 讠+ body 身+ inch 寸
</li>
<li>
<span class="bigger">妹</span>
	younger sister = woman 女+ not-yet 未
</li>
<li>
<span class="bigger">你</span>
	you = person 人 + bow 𠂉 + small 小
</li>
<li>
<span class="bigger">名</span>
	name = evening 夕 + mouth 口
</li>
<li>
<span class="bigger">样</span>
	appearance = tree 木 + sheep 羊
</li>
</ul>
<p>
	I love learning these because every character is like a tiny poem.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigger">语</span>
	language = words 讠+ five 五+ mouth 口
</p>
<p>
	So a language is words that five mouths speak?
	Brilliant!
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigger">谢</span>
	thanks = words 讠+ body 身+ inch 寸
</p>
<p>
	Hmmm... so.... when you say thanks, you speak words that give a body an inch of space?
	Interesting.
</p>
<p>
<span class="bigger">名</span>
	name = evening 夕 + mouth 口
</p>
<p>
	So your real name is what’s spoken by a mouth in the evening?
	That’s kind of romantic.
</p>
<p>
	They’re so vivid.
	I try to imagine the historical or cultural meaning behind each one.
</p>
<h2>
	Projecting meaning into Talking Heads lyrics
</h2>
<p>
	Talking Heads were a great band from the late-70s to mid-80s.
	Their lyrics were really evocative and mysterious.
	Specific but vague.
	Made you wonder what they were really about.
</p>
<p>
	Here’s an example:
</p>
<p>
	Watch out - you might get what you’re after
<br>
	Cool babies - strange but not a stranger
<br>
	I’m an ordinary guy
<br>
	Burning down the house
</p>
<p>
	No visible means of support and you have not seen nuthin’ yet
<br>
	Everything’s stuck together
<br>
	I don’t know what you expect staring into the TV set
<br>
	Fighting fire with fire
</p>
<p>
	All wet - hey you might need a raincoat
<br>
	Shakedown - dreams walking in broad daylight
<br>
	Three hundred sixty five degrees
<br>
	Burning down the house
</p>
<p>
	I read an interview with David Byrne from the Talking Heads who said that many of their lyrics were just random.
	Literally!
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	They would write evocative phrases onto little pieces of paper, then throw them into a bowl, and shuffle them up.
</strong>
	Then they’d pull them out in random order, and put them into the song in that order.
	They did this because <strong>they liked how the listener creates meaning that wasn’t intended.</strong>
</p>
<p>
	Hearing one phrase next to another makes you assume they’re connected in a meaningful way.
	But nope.
	It was just random.
<strong>
	You made that meaning yourself.
</strong>
</p>
<h2>
	Back to Chinese.
</h2>
<p>
	I have a Chinese dictionary called <a href="http://www.wenlin.com/">Wenlin</a> that tells the history behind every character.
</p>
<p>
	I looked up <span class="bigger">谢</span>, <span class="bigger">你</span>, and the rest, and found that those characters are just phonetic.
	Those composite character bits were not chosen for their meaning, just their sound.
</p>
<p>
	So... it seems <strong>I’ve just been putting the meanings into them, myself</strong>.
	They actually had no meaning.
</p>
<p>
	But even knowing that, I choose to keep doing it.
	It’s poetic.
	It’s beautiful.
</p>
<h2>
	Projecting meaning into everything?
</h2>
<p>
	How many other things in life really have no meaning?
</p>
<p>
	She was born April 12.
	He was born September 22.
	What does it mean?
</p>
<p>
	One day you ride your bike instead of taking the bus.
	That day your usual bus gets into a big accident.
	What does it mean?
</p>
<p>
	Black cat crosses your path as you walk under a ladder on Friday the 13th.
	What does it mean?
</p>
<p>
	Nothing at all.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	Nothing has inherent meaning.
</strong>
	It is what it is and that’s it.
</p>
<p>
<strong>
	We just choose to project meaning onto things.
</strong>
	It feels good.
</p>
<p>
	Even if presented with proof that it’s totally random or neutral, we decide it has meaning anyway.
	It makes life more poetic and beautiful.
</p>
<p>
	(And what if you’ve projected some bad meaning onto something, and it’s getting you down?
	Don’t forget that none of it is true.
	You’re the one that put the meaning into it.
	You can just as easily take all the meaning out of it.)
