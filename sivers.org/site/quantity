<p>
	My first job ever was telemarketing: renewing people’s subscriptions to Time magazine.
	We worked on commission.
</p><p>
	When I started, I used to meekly ask, “Um. Hello. Your subscription is coming up for renewal. I’m wondering if, maybe, perhaps, you might want to renew it again this year?”
</p><p>
	My sales were so terrible that the boss told the manager to fire me.
</p><p>
	But the manager thought I was cute, so she let me listen in to the top salesman on the floor.
	Here’s how his calls would go:
</p><p>
	“Hi there this is George Amos from Time Magazine, and I’m calling to renew your subscription today.
	I notice you’ve been wasting money by renewing only one year at a time, $54/year, and I hate to see you waste money like that, so let’s get you in for a three-year subscription, bringing your price down to only $25/year.
	That way, as the price of that one-year renewal keeps going up each year, it won’t matter to you, because you were smart and got in at the half-price rate for three years.
	Now are you still at the same address?”
</p><p>
	If they complained about the price of a three-year subscription, he’d say, “Ok — we’ll just do a two-year renewal, then.”
</p><p>
	If they complained about that, he’d say, “Alright - a one-year renewal it is.”
</p><p>
	It was amazing that <strong>he made a sale with almost every call</strong>, whereas I would call almost 200 people before finally making one sale.
</p><p>
	But after listening in to a few of his calls I imitated his approach, and within a few weeks I became the top salesman on the floor!
</p><p>
	It’s easy.
	Just get into the right mindset.
	You’d be surprised what a huge difference it makes.
</p><p>
	A band on CD Baby called Celldweller did this wonderfully.
	When their new album came out, they emailed their fans and said, “Our new album is out tomorrow, and nobody anywhere has it yet.
	If you buy only one, the price is $12.
	But if you buy more than one, the price is only $9 each.
	So buy 10.
	It will cost you $90, but you’ll be able to sell them to your friends for $12 each and make a profit.”
</p><p>
	What’s amazing is <strong>most of them did!</strong>
	Most who didn’t buy 10 would <strong>apologize</strong> at the end of the order form, saying, “Sorry I don’t have $90 now, but I’ll buy 5 copies today and come back for 5 more soon.”
</p><p>
	They sold thousands of CDs in a couple weeks, and became the top-seller of the year.
