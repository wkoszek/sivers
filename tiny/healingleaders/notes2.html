            <p><strong>CONFLICT
            AS A TEACHER </strong><br>
By Bill Southworth</p>
            <p>Last month this column
              examined people's tendency to separate and exclude others on the basis
              of their differences - behavior, appearance, statements
              made, opinions held. It also examined some of the reasons why we behave
              in this manner. This month's column will look at some other root causes
              of this tendency to separate and exclude, often leading to conflict.</p>
            <p>We've
              all probably excluded others based on these differences. Where did
              we learn to exclude others? As we were growing up the main candidates
              were family, relatives, neighbors, schools, the media, and the organizations
              we belonged to--any place where significant people in our lives influenced
              how we thought, felt, and behaved. They were our opinion, belief, and
              habit formers as we grew up. We heard and saw exclusionary, even divisive
              remarks and actions from those significant people, and these behaviors
              often became our models of how to respond to differences. As far as
              I know there is no gene dictating that we separate other people based
              on
              their differences. It's a learned habit and as such can be unlearned. </p>
            <p>In working to prevent
              and resolve conflict I have used a number of successful strategies
              and tools, one of which is called the Ladder
              of Inference,
              developed by Chris Argyris. (See The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook-Peter
              Senge, et al). The Ladder points out how easily we categorize people
              and their behavior, and then act on the results of our thinking,
              often mistakenly. The Ladder consists of 7 rungs, but I use an edited
              version.
              On the first rung is only what we see and/or hear. It's what a video
              camera would record - data only, no assumptions, judgments, or conclusions.
              However, we are quick to climb the Ladder, selecting only certain
              of the data (information) we have &quot;recorded.&quot; This screening
              process is heavily influenced by our beliefs. Already we have begun
              the process
              that can lead to separating and isolating other people. We next add
              some cultural and personal meaning to this data and continue up the
              Ladder
              by making assumptions about the data (information) we have selected.
              From there we move to the rung where we draw conclusions. The rung
              above is where we adopt certain beliefs, based on the way we have handled
              the
              data (information) on the lower rungs. Our prejudices lie at the belief
              rung.</p>
            <p>Ascending the Ladder can happen in a split second. The key to using
              this tool is to be aware of each of these rungs, how quickly you
              go up the
              Ladder when something happens, on which rung you might stop, and
              how you act as a result. In the variation that I've adapted, I
              ask people
              to examine how their actions might differ at each rung. For example,
              imagine you are in the first meeting of a committee you recently
              joined. The meeting starts at 8:30 and Bob, a business owner in
              his late 50's,
              walks in at 9. The thoughts in the room would probably vary from &quot;He's
              late,&quot; to &quot;People are always coming late to meetings,&quot; to &quot;He
              had something important to do,&quot; to &quot;This meeting must
              not be important to him,&quot; to &quot;This is typical of how
              men of his age behave.&quot; People quickly climb up the Ladder.
              Our actions toward Bob might also vary from welcoming him and doing
              a 1-minute recap to
              making some snide, exclusionary remark to him. </p>
            <p>Where
              we are on the Ladder and what action we take can either prevent a conflict
              situation or start one. We are in daily contact with
              that Ladder of Inference at home, at work and in the community
              so there's
              lots of opportunity to use it. Go slowly up the Ladder and maybe
              even stop half way up if that will work. Like a real ladder,
              if
              you go up
              too quickly or too high, it might very well bring you (and others)
              crashing to the ground.</p>
