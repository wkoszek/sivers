            <p><strong>PEOPLE
              HEARING BUT NOT LISTENING</strong><br>
By Bill Southworth</p>
            <p>In
              the communication process there are two essential parts to effective
              communication: speaking and listening. We seem to focus primarily on
              the speaking part, that is, effective delivery of a thought, opinion,
              or position on an issue. I see the continued popularity of Toast Masters
              and presentation skills workshops among so many of my clients. On the
              other hand, listening, as in listening to understand, is the part of
              effective communication that receives much less emphasis and yet is the
              most critical. </p>
            <p>This
              and future articles will explores some of the bad listening habits
              that are barriers to good communication, as well as
              good listening habits.
              It's important to understand first what's not working with your listening
              habit(s) before moving on to change those habits. I think each reader
              will be able to identify with at least one of these habits. When you
              recognize a habit you will probably have some clues about your part
              in ineffective communication. These clues will significantly contribute
              to better relationships at home, at work, in your communities, and
              in
              the world.</p>
            <p>There
              is a wide variety of ineffective listening habits that people develop
              over the years, often based upon how they have been
              listened
              to from
              early childhood up to the present time. I put listening in quotes
              simply because true listening is often not happening. There may be
              only a
              mechanical process of just hearing words, and it appears that some
              form of communication
              is taking place. But true listening in which the speaker feels understood
              is not happening. </p>
            <p><img src="images/dog.jpg" width="250" height="167" align="right">In
              a March 27th column in The Cortez Journal I mentioned that we have
              a tendency to exclude people on the basis of
              their differences
              (from
              us). These differences may be based on race, gender, age, ethnic
              group, nationality, religious belief, political ideology, income
              and opinions.
              This exclusionary behavior shows up quite clearly in how we listen
              to the people we exclude. In some instances we refuse to listen
              to them
              by simply avoiding them and any contact with their written or spoken
              views. We don't want to hear their point of view, let alone try
              to understand it. We've already made up our minds about them and decided
              to exclude
              them. In this case no communication takes place and therefore there
              is no understanding. It's our right to avoid people and opinions
              we don't
              agree with, but I believe that leaves us in a weaker position as
              family, community and nation. For example, think of all the times
              you have
              avoided eye contact or discussing a difficult topic with a family
              member or neighbor. </p>
            <p>In
              other situations when we can't avoid contact with people we'd rather
              exclude, we may listen in a variety of ways.
              For example,
              there is
              the Mindset Approach in which we have already decided what we
              think they
              are going to say, we know we won't agree and nothing they say
              will change our minds about their opinions or about them as people. </p>
            <p>Or
              we use The-Best-Defense-is-a-Good-Offense Approach in which we launch
              into stating our position on an issue before the other
              parties
              are
              ready to express their position. We want the advantage of the
              high ground so
              we dominate the time and don't care about equal time or a level
              playing field for others to express their ideas.</p>
            <p>Or
              we try the Reload Approach in which we listen just carefully enough
              to figure
              out what to reload to make our own points
              during a counterattack
              on the other's views. The moment there is some slight break
              in the action we jump back in to keep pushing our point.
              This works
              well
              as a strategy
              for a debate or a courtroom, but not well for effective communication.
              Like the other approaches, it undermines effective listening
              and therefore effective communication. </p>
            <p>Do
              you use these non-listening tactics? <br>
              Do you know others who use them? <br>
              How are your communications? </p>
