<h2>Kaz Hagedorn:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Clinic Owner/ Senior Therapist/ Dry Needling Tutor</li>
	<li>Dip. Therapeutic Massage (NZCM 2008)</li>
	<li>Advanced Cert. Dry Needling &amp; Pain Management</li>
	<li>Cert. Sports Massage</li>
	<li>Cert. Trigger Point Therapy</li>
	<li>Cert. Joint Mobilisation</li>

</ul>
<p>
My practice is focused towards sports, deep tissue &amp; remedial massage techniques, Trigger Point therapy (TrP), pain management, dry needling &amp; deep tissue pregnancy massage.
</p><p>
I have recently started co-teaching dry needling and pain management courses with Joannes Boele van Hensbroek, helping other professionals learn needling and how to integrate pain management techniques into their clinical practice.
</p><p>
Many prominent sports teams and gyms have put the recovery of their athletes in my hands, including the All Blacks, 2015 Wellington Hurricanes and Lions, All Blacks Sevens team, NZ Blackcaps, RoyalNZ Ballet, Toa Crossfit (Wellington), Sydney Swans FC AFL team, Vodafone Warriors, USA 7s team, Wellington Firebirds, Wellington Phoenix, Melbourne Heart FC, Queensland Roar FC, Wellington Colts under 21 Rugby prems and various other elite athletes from many different sporting codes.
</p><p>
I am also the official fight Massage Therapist for the Muay Thai Institute – Wellington’s MTI GYM (kickboxing) providing rehabilitation massage to many champion fighters, during their fight training and post-event to aid injury reduction and recovery. 
</p><p>
I enjoy giving deep tissue, therapeutic and sports massage - with a strong emphasis on the treatment, relaxation and recovery benefits that this can bring.
</p><p>
I thrive on professional development and regularly partake in courses to keep my skill-base at a top level - and to round it all off, I practice what I preach and receive regular massages to keep my own body in check.

<h1>Services</h1>
<p>
We strive to bring you the very best in body therapy services - from massage, to dry needling.
</p><p>
As humans, we all fluctuate daily with diet, hormones, moods, stresses and physical activity.
</p><p>
Not every day is the same, so why should your treatments be the same, boring experience every time?
</p><p>
We tailor every treatment to your particular needs, on the day - as part of your “bigger picture” treatment plan.
</p><p>
Some call it Holistic, we call it “being a real-life person, with real-life needs”.
</p>
<h2>Massage:</h2>
<p>
Deep tissue, Trigger Point Therapy, Sports, Pregnancy treatments, Firm Relaxation, Myofascial Release.. we do it all!
</p>
<h2>Dry Needling:</h2>
<p>
Like acupuncture, dry needling uses very fine needles that are inserted into muscles and tissues of the body.
It is a very effective way to compliment massages and physical treatments, as a way of relieving tension and trigger points found in muscles.
</p>
<h2>Onsite Massage:</h2>
<p>
Onsite massage is a safe, practical and effective way to treat a large amount of people in a shorter timeframe.
Suitable for: Sports teams, corporate businesses and events, expos, shows, back stage at concert venues, festivals and more!
