<h1>MuckWork</h1>
<p>MuckWork is a <strong>managed team of assistants</strong> that specialize in helping musicians with their uncreative dirty work.</p>

<h2>Not enough time to “Do It Yourself”?</h2>
<p>
In this “Do It Yourself” music world, you’re expected to not only be a great musician, writer, and performer, but also promoter, designer, communicator, agent, and more.
</p>
<p>
You know there’s all this stuff you should be doing, but you don’t have enough time!
</p>
<p>
If you ask for help, friends’ favors wear out, well-meaning people flake, and the affordable ones aren’t very good.
</p>

<h2>The solution: a network of reliable assistants</h2>
<p>
MuckWork will have a big network of people around the world that are great at helping musicians with the boring stuff that can be done from anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Because we’ll have a huge network of people available to help, you never have to worry about someone flaking on you.  <strong>MuckWork will take reponsibility to get your job done</strong>, whatever it may be.
