DW Sivers Company is a second- and third-generation family business with a more than 60 year history in Portland, Oregonâ€™s commercial real estate industry. We are proud to be a women-owned business with a majority of stock held by women active in the company operations and management. We are also proud to be majority employee-owned, boasting a small team of financial, construction, operations, development and property management professionals with an average tenure measured in decades rather than years.
</p><p>
DW Sivers Company has maintained our strength and reputation over time through an emphasis on strong business relationships, prudent financial management, integrity and careful selection of projects. Rather than focusing on explosive growth or a high profile, the Sivers team strives for quality and long term stability, maintaining a company in a community that can continue to thrive for generations to come.
