The Sivers Companies origins can be traced back to 1952, when Mr. Win Sivers first started a construction company. Today, at the heart of the Sivers Companies is DW Sivers Company, a real estate investment, management and development company with a diverse background in industrial, retail and office buildings as well as in large, single-tenant specialty buildings such as athletic facilities and movie theaters. 
</p><p>
As an independent family business with an exceptionally strong foundation, the Sivers Companies have thrived for well over half a century by carefully evolving as markets change and new opportunities present themselves. 
</p><p>
With a heavy background in industrial commercial real estate, during the 1980’s and 1990’s DW Sivers Company was the Portland leader in developing “build-to-suit” industrial and flex space, buying land in speculation of growing markets. The Company's portfolio includes clients such as the Leatherman Tool Group Inc. and the American Nation Red Cross. 
</p><p>
At the same time DW Sivers Company was highly active in the development of retail and office properties, contributing to a portfolio in excess of 2 million square feet. The Barnes Miller Village (Portland) and Windy's Corner (Portland) shopping centers exemplify the Sivers Companies' experience in the retail market. Office complexes such as Airport Plaza West (PDX) and Courtside (Vancouver, WA) are examples of class A and B office projects.
</p><p>
Over time and through strong partnerships DW Sivers Company developed a specialty in athletic facilities. Like the Industrial and flex space buildings the team was so familiar with, these properties have large buildings with a single, specialty purpose tenant. DW Sivers Company participated as a developer in the design and execution of three projects with The Hoop USA, Inc. DW Sivers Company and partners also developed the Hawthorn Farm complex in Hillsboro, Oregon, which includes a retail building, office building and Hawthorn Farm Athletic Club. 
</p><p>
From the late 1990s through 2012, DW Sivers Company put together an athletic club operations team that owned and managed Hawthorn Farm Athletic Club, acquired the historic RiverPlace Athletic Club in Portland, and helped finalize plans for and open Bethany Athletic Club. These three businesses, collectively known as the Oregon Athletic Clubs, were thriving when they were sold to an outside entity with grand expansion plans in 2012. Unfortunately that outside entity did not succeed. In 2015 DW Sivers Company re-opened Hawthorn Farm Athletic Club, once again acting as tenant and Landlord to this independent, high-end club. 
</p><p>
Most recently DW Sivers Company has used its expertise in large, single tenant building development and business operations in movie theater complex development. The company is a part of the highly successful Maya Cinema development group.
</p><p>
Because DW Sivers Company has long-term experience not only as a developer, but in property investment, management and as a tenant/operator, we have a uniquely deep understanding of the industry. Over the decades, DW Sivers Company has further established sound relationships and financial strength and credibility. These relationships have proven paramount in today's commercial climate.
