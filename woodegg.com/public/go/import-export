<p>You’ve heard about the successes of entrepreneurs importing and exporting products from Asia. You’ve considered taking on the challenge yourself. After all, it sounds great, and there is an immense opportunity in product sourcing, importing, and exporting.</p>

<p>You’ve already read some blogs, listened to business podcasts, and you may have launched (and run) a business or two from home with moderate success.</p>

<p>While you’ve had success in business in your own country, you know that importing/exporting from Asia is a much different challenge.</p>

<p>Negotiating with Asian suppliers, designing the product, using tools like Alibaba and Amazon……there are many intricacies in the process. Plus, you may not have an in-depth understanding of Asian culture.</p>

<p>But still, you’re itching for the challenge. You understand the potential of importing and exporting products from Asia. There’s a reason why Alibaba, China’s biggest online e-commerce company, handled over $240 billion in sales in 2013 with just two of their websites!</p>

<p>And you want to take advantage of this opportunity.</p>

<p>That’s exactly why we wrote this book — to help people like you who want to succeed at importing and exporting products from Asia.</p>
