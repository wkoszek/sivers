We’re using Markdown - <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown> - as the source code for the ebook.  This raw Markdown text will be converted into the different ebook formats - PDF, ePub, Mobi, and HTML.

But we’re only using a small part of Markdown.  No tables, no linked text, and no images.  So here are the only parts you need to know, with some formatting guidelines for the book.

(This tutorial is meant for you to play around with.  Change anything on the left to watch it change on the right.)

### URLs

URLs need brackets around them to be clickable.  See how http://woodegg.com/ is not clickable but <http://woodegg.com/> is.

The reason we need to show the full URL instead of just linking words is that some people may be reading this on a Kindle without internet access, or some may be printing an essay to read on paper.  They need to see the URLs.  Everyone else needs them to be easy to click.

So the compromise is to include the URL in the sentence, like I did with the Markdown Wikipedia link up top, separated by dashes or parentheses to make it read well and click well.

Please always click the links in the preview window, to make sure they work before marking an essay as finished.

### Lists

Please see this great article on “How Users Read on the Web”, especially the Nebraska examples: <http://www.useit.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/>

Since this isn’t a paper book, we’re not trying to conserve vertical space.  So if you’re listing anything, consider making it a real list, using this format:

* just an asterisk
* at the start of the line
* followed by a space

Always leave an empty line before and after a list.

You won’t often need a numbered list, but they are done like this:

1. just a number
2. at the start of the line
3. followed by a period
4. then a space

But **please pay attention to this next example**, because it’s unintuitive and very common in this book.  Use this format any time you are listing **companies with URLs or addresses**, **books with ISBN numbers**, or any list of things where each thing has some extra info with it.

* Derek’s site  
  <http://sivers.org/>

* Wood Egg site  
  <http://woodegg.com/>

* Aksioma & Partners  
  Jakarta  
  <http://www.aksiomalaw.com/>

* Austrindo Law Office  
  Bali  
  <http://www.austrindo.com/>

There are some invisible spaces there, so please follow these instructions:

1. Start it like a normal list.
2. Add **two spaces to the end of the line** to make a line break.
3. Leave **two spaces at the start of the next line** to make it a continuation of that list item.
4. Leave an empty line before starting the next list item.

Go play with those examples, above.  Notice that if you remove the two spaces after “Derek’s site” that the URL is no longer on its own line.

Lastly, **do not do this**:

° fake list item one  
° fake list item two  

Those little bullet things are added by programs like Microsoft Word.  While they look OK on the page now, they are **not** real list items, and will not look right when converting them to all the different ebook formats.  Please only use real lists starting either with an asterisk or a number, as described above.  (Please don’t use Microsoft Word.)

### Subheaders

If an essay is long and needs to be broken into separate sections, use subheaders like I have on this page.  (URLs, Lists, Subheaders, Bold/Italic)

Three “#”, followed by a space.  Ideally an empty line before and after, too.

Please **don’t use bold print to make a subheader**.  Use this “### ” format.  This tells the different ebook formats that this is a section, and will put it in the nested table of contents.  If you just bold some words, it won’t work right.

### Bold/Italic

To be used sparingly, but if you need emphasis, here’s how it works:

Just *one asterisk* around a phrase or word will make it *italic*.

Use **two asterisks** around a phrase or word to make it **bold**.

That’s it!
