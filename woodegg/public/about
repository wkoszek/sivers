<h2>April 2014 Announcement:</h2>
<p>
<strong>Wood Egg founder Derek Sivers has brought on Janet Chang to be CEO for Wood Egg for 2014.</strong>
</p>
<h3>What this means</h3>
<p>
Derek will still be supporting the development of Wood Egg. He will just be less involved on the day-to-day operational level. That means Wood Egg customers and supporters will be hearing more from Janet from now on.
</p>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>
We believe the biggest benefit we can provide business owners is to empower them to take action on the information provided in the Wood Egg Startup Guides. For that reason, this year will be dedicated to helping entrepreneurs and business owners apply insights from the Startup Guides through a combination of various communities, tools, and information products.
</p>
<p>
We are hoping to branch out to serving more business owners working in Asia and around the world, with more than the Wood Egg Startup Guide series.  Instead of continuing with an annually updated series of 17 guides for 16 countries in Asia, we are thinking bigger and broader: a series of continually updated solutions that keep business owners informed on business and culture that would allow them to <strong>immediately apply insights from the Startup Guides to their own work.</strong>
</p>

<h2>Letter from CEO, Janet Chang:</h2>
<p>
To all fans, followers, and supporters of Wood Egg and Derek Sivers:
</p><p>
Hi there! You may not have heard about me until now, so here is a bit of back story:
</p><p>
As a big but quiet fan of Derek since 2009, it was with great gratitude that I took the opportunity to author <a href="/cn">Wood Egg's China Startup Guide 2014</a>.
</p><p>
It started with one email to Derek in June of 2013, which turned into a research trip to Beijing, China, a flurry of writing back at home in the U.S., then a finished book about the size of a Harry Potter novel merely 3 months later. Whew!
</p><p>
I'm thankful for Derek and our manager for managing all the behind-the-scenes details of publishing the guides, proud of the China Startup Guide team, and happy to have met many other members of the Wood Egg Startup Guides team who tirelessly hustled to bring the other country guides into fruition.
</p><p>
Now, it is with even greater gratitude that I'll be taking the opportunity to enable Wood Egg to promote entrepreneurship all around the world, as Derek originally envisioned.
</p><p>
Our goal for 2014 is to go beyond the Asia Startup Guide ebooks, and create practical solutions for entrepreneurs building companies and others doing business in Asia. This is a personal passion for both Derek and myself, and I'm excited to see how we can potentially help you this year and beyond.
</p><p>
To your success and happiness,
</p><p>
<em> - Janet</em>
